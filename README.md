This is the official Android SDK for [Stream Video](https://getstream.io/video/docs/android/basics/tutorial/), a service for building powerful Audio and Video communication applications. The library includes several layers of control and customizability. Most users will want to start with our higher level components that let you put together UI, services like push notifications, Picture-In-Picture mode, background support and more.

Once you're familiarized with the SDK, you can rely on the low-level-client and build fully custom UI and behavior based on the state we provide.

The Android SDK supports both Kotlin and Java, as well as Jetpack Compose and XML for UI. We _strongly recommend_ using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose as they provide the most flexibility, customizability and the best developer experience.
