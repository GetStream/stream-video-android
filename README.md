This is the official Android SDK for [Stream Video](https://getstream.io/video?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Github_Repo_Content_Ad&utm_content=Developer&utm_campaign=Github_Android_Video_SDK&utm_term=DevRelOss), a service for building video calls, audio rooms, and live-streaming applications. This library includes both a low-level video SDK and a set of reusable UI components.
Most users start with the Compose UI components and fall back to the lower-level API when they want to customize things.

## üõ• What is Stream?

Stream allows developers to rapidly deploy scalable feeds, chat messaging and video with an industry leading 99.999% uptime SLA guarantee.

Stream provides UI components and state handling that make it easy to build video calling for your app. All calls run on Stream's network of edge servers around the world, ensuring optimal latency and reliability.

## üìï Tutorials

With Stream's video components, you can use their SDK to build in-app video calling, audio rooms, audio calls, or live streaming. The best place to get started is with their tutorials:
