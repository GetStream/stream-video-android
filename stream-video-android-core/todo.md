### 0.1 milestone

- [ ] Audio volume was too low (probably a bug related to speakerphone vs earpiece)
- [ ] Video disconnects sometimes. (BufferQueue has not connected producer and Stop capture: Nulling session. Could be related to the peer connection breaking)
- [ ] Tests should run on CI (and we need to speed it up a bit) (Jaewoong)
- [ ] Review updatePublishQuality. Verify layer enable/disable works (Jaewoong)
- [ ] Testing session with team cross platform (Thierry)
- [ ] Publish 0.1 on Maven
- [~] Audio room tutorial & Feedback cycle with team
- [~] Reconnect flow can't reconnect the subscriber (SFU doesn't support restarts on the subscriber peer connection yet)
- [~] Graceful SFU shutdown (switch between SFUs)
- [X] Video calling tutorial & Feedback cycle with team
- [X] Bluetooth gives a permissions error on AndroidDeviceTest. We shouldn't require BLUETOOTH_CONNECT by default
- [X] Retry: Default coordinator/sfu retry policy needs work
- [X] Retry: onNegotiationNeeded
- [X] updateParticipantSubscriptions is called twice with the same resolution. Default resolution is wrong
- [X] Handle retry error conditions in RtcSession
- [X] Cleanup the readme and add a nice graphic. Make the repo public after that
- [X] Crash on interceptor (broken stack trace, check logs)
- [X] Ring support & Docs (Jc)
- [X] React component to load API key, user and token for video demo flow in the tutorials
- [X] Disable reconnect
- [X] Tests should run (currently some coroutine issues)
- [X] Tests should have a normal delay on the health check (right now it skips delays)
- [X] Tests. Token expiration is broken. Hard to debug due to broken stack traces



### Server wishlist (june 8th)

- Reactions should have an id fields and a createdAt
- Query calls should support Map<String, Any?> instead of Any (not nullable)
- Do we have a permission level for people who created the call? IE i should be able to broadcast my own call
- call.wentLiveAt or similar isn't available
- goLive should support "notify" flag
- getCall should return members and allow pagination on them
- call type should have a setting if "speaker" or "earpiece" should be the default. for an audio call earpiece makes sense. for an audio_room speaker is a better default


### Docs ~1 week left

- [X] UI cookbook
- [X] UI components
- [X] Low level docs

### TODO ~1 week


- [ ] Share example with backend team for resolution degradation
- [ ] Go through all tests & TODOs and update with latest server changes.
- [ ] Fine tune the quality on S23 (so it's not at Q). Upload quality, make it easy to change
- [ ] Add a timeout for waiting on the socket authentication events
- [ ] Improve our error classes. Right now there are 4 different formats. 
- [ ] XML version of VideoRenderer
- [ ] Bluetooth issue (turning off or on bluetooth device doesn't switch from headset to speaker phone. also broken in whatsapp)
- [X] Error handling could be improved
- [X] HTTP requests fail in interceptor, which is wrong. (see https://console.firebase.google.com/project/stream-video-9b586/crashlytics/app/android:io.getstream.video.android.dogfooding.debug/issues?state=open&time=last-seven-days&tag=all&sort=eventCount)
- [X] Speaker phone selection isn't right, should use the preferences of all 4, or only switch when its an earpiece, not switch from bluetooth
- [X] use standard debug, verbose, info, warning and error debug levels on StreamVideoBuilder
- [X] Android volume is too low when calling from react
- [X] permission handling on the intro/preview screen is wrong. it starts out as video enabled
- [X] RED error
- [X] Use the right date time class everywhere
- [X] Join is called in the preview screen, this is wrong
- [X] Full test coverage for retries + some more logging
- [X] Only run 1 connection retry flow at once. We should keep on retrying.
- [X] Participant sorting rules. See Call sortedParticipants
- [X] Pinning of participants. You pin/unpin and it sets pinnedAt and sorting takes it into account
- [X] Pause option on camera & microphone & speaker
- [X] When the phone is locked, we shouldn't be upload video
- [X] Background usage causes the camera to freeze and not recover when in foreground
- [X] When the app is in background (and PIP is disabled), what should the behaviour be?

### Server issues

#### Livestream

- [X] Failure(value=NetworkError(message=GetOrCreateCall failed with error: "User 'thierry' with role 'user' is not allowed to perform action CreateCall in scope 'video:livestream'", serverErrorCode=17, statusCode=403, cause=java.lang.Throwable: https://getstream.io/chat/docs/api_errors_response))
- [X] hlsPlaylistUrl vs ingress/egress
- [ ] Livestreaming where do i see when the call started

#### Audio room

- [ ] queryCalls should support Any? for the filter, otherwise you can't search for filters matching null
- [ ] socket connection hangs when joining as an anon user

#### Regular calls

- [X] ICE restarts & join flow polish
- [X] Ringing call support
- [ ] getCall doesn't support member limits
- [ ] Events for creating a channel on chat. so you lazy load the chat when the first person opens it

### App & Compose

- [X] Telemetry to firebase/crashlytics (with an opt out, or research alternatives)
- [ ] Call Preview components (CallLobbyContent + CallLobbyViewModel)
- [X] Reactions don't show up
- [ ] Chat integration (we need an event from the server though)
- [ ] PIP
- [ ] When state._connection.value = RtcConnectionState.Reconnecting we should show a little transparent. “Reconnecting” UI element
- [ ] Ringing calls + CallService + foreground services/notifications (wait for push and updated endpoints from server)
- [X] Screensharing doesn't show up
- [X] Improve screensharing (zoomable + fallback)


### Reconnect

- [X] Retry on joining a call
- [X] Session.reconnect
- [X] Session.switchSfu
- [X] Connection state for UI indicators. state.connection
- [X] Monitoring that determines when to reconnect, or switchSfu


### High level issues

- [X] Join flow is too slow
- [X] Call id should probably be optional and default to a random UUID


### Available tasks up for grabs (little things)

- [X] Currently we use UserPreferencesManager. Jaewoong mentioned we should perhaps explore https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore



### Reconnect & Cross device testing ~2 weeks

- [X] Max resolution, simulcast and codec preferences should be easy to change
- [X] SFU needs to support sending some testing tracks for integration testing
- [X] We might need overwrites for the defaults at the device level
- [X] Track the FPS messages from webrtc camera capture



### RTC & Media TODO

- [X] Improve how we mangle SDP tokens. (edit the audio line and video line, don't swap lines)
- [X] Media manager tests & decide on microphone/speaker split
- [X] Leave & End flows
- [X] Enable & Test dynascale
- [X] Opus Red
- [X] Opus DTX
- [X] Clean up the media manager class Mic management
- [X] Move enabling/disabling/state and clean it up
- [X] Move setCameraEnabled & setMicrophoneEnabled
- [X] Clean up the media manager class Camera management
- [X] Ensure errors from sfu are bubbled up
- [X] Media manager class to enable easy testing of all audio/video stuff
- [X] Tests that verify the local track is working
- [X] Tests that verify we are sending our local track
- [X] setLocalTrack is not called



### State TODO

- [X] Permissions requests need an accept/reject flow
- [X] Call settings need to be used everywhere. There are still some hardcoded settings
- [X] Member state isn't implemented fully. Could be either a state or just a data class
- [X] Call state isn't setup fully on join
- [X] Member state isn't updated correctly or implemented

### LLC TODO

- [X] Test coverage
- [X] Clean up tests
- [X] Support for accepting/rejecting calls etc. HTTP endpoints seem cleaner
- [X] Directly use the events from openAPI to prevent things being out of sync
- [X] List of backend changes
- [X] Make call level client methods internal
- [X] Moderation API endpoints
  https://www.notion.so/stream-wiki/Moderation-Permissions-for-video-37a3376268654095b9aafaba12d4bb69
  https://www.notion.so/stream-wiki/Call-Permissions-832f914ad4c545cf8f048012900ad21d
- [X] Guest and anon user support

### Server wishlist

- [X] queryChannels doesn’t return members but CallUsers, this is wrong
- [X] Update call endpoints doesn’t expose team or startsAt. I get why we don’t expose team, not sure about startsAt
- [X] Get/Create etc don’t specify connection_id, this breaks the ability to watch
- [X] Not being able to edit settings on a call you created seems like the wrong default: “”User ‘thierry’ with role ‘user’ is not allowed to perform action UpdateCallSettings in scope ‘video:default’“, serverErrorCode=17, statusCode=-1, cause=java.lang.Throwable: ))”
- [X] Participant.online field is weird. Aren't you always online as a participant?
- [X] Participant count & Anonymous Participant Count (for livestreams you cant rely on the list). Returned by SFU. Updated by
- [X] ConnectionQualityInfo is a list, audio levels is a map. Lets standardize


### Server side - Call type settings

- [X] target resolution / max resolution (default 960) (if you're livestreaming you want to publish at 1080p or 4k typically)
- [X] if we should default to front or back camera
- [X] should video be default on or off. I join a call, should i be publishing video?
- [X] should audio be default on or off. I join a call, should i publishing audio?
- [X] am i allowed to publish (IE should i create the publisher peer connection) (it's in own capabilitiy. send video and send audio)
- [X] should volume be enabled by default (for livestreams and audio rooms its typically off by default)
