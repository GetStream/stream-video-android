/**
 * Connection state shows if we've established a connection with the SFU
 * - join state (did we try to setup the RtcSession yes or no?). API calls can fail during the join and require us to repeat it
 * - socket connection health. the socket can disconnect.
 * - peer connection subscriber
 * - peer connection publisher
 * - network detection might be faster than the peer connection
 * The call connection state is the health of these 5 components
 *
 * Note that the video connection can still be working even if:
 * * the socket is disconnected
 * * publisher is disconnected
 *
 * When the connection breaks the subscriber peer connection will usually indicate the issue first (since it has constant traffic)
 * The subscriber can break because of 2 reasons:
 * * Something is wrong with your network (90% of the time)
 * * Something is wrong with the SFU (should be rare)
 *
 * We want the reconnect to be as fast as possible.
 * * If you can reach our edge network your connection is fine. So the optimal flow here is
 * * When there is an error try to connect to the same SFU immediately
 * * Meanwhile ask the API if we need to switch to a different
 * * If the API says we need to switch, swap to the new SFU
 *
 * Note that the SFU doesnt set up the subscriber ice connection if nobody is publishing
