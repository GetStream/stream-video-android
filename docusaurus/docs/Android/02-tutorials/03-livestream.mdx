## Livestream Tutorial

In this tutorial we'll quickly build a low-latency in-app livestreaming experience.
The livestream is broadcasted using Stream's edge network of servers around the world.
We'll cover the following topics:

* Ultra low latency streaming
* Multiple streams & co-hosts
* RTMP in and Webrtc input
* Exporting to HLS
* Reactions, custom events and chat
* Recording & Transcriptions

Let's get started, if you have any questions or feedback be sure to let us know via the feedback button.

### Step 1 - Create a new project in Android Studio

This tutorial was written using Android Studio Flamingo.
Setup steps can vary slightly across Android Studio versions so if you run into trouble be sure to use the latest version of Android Studio.

1. Create a new project
2. Select Phone & Template -> **empty activity**
3. Name your project **Livestream**.

### Step 2 - Install the SDK & Setup the client

**Add the video SDK** to your app's `build.gradle` file found in app/build.gradle.
If you're new to android note that there are 2 build.gradle files, you want to open the one in the app folder.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android-compose:$stream_version"
}
```

This tutorial uses the compose version of the SDK. Stream also provides a core library without compose.

### Step 3 - Broadcast a livestream from your phone

The following code shows how to publish from your phone's camera.
Let's open `MainActivity.kt` and replace the `MainActivity` class with the following code:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        val userToken = "REPLACE_WITH_TOKEN"
        val userId = "REPLACE_WITH_USER_ID"
        val callId = "REPLACE_WITH_CALL_ID"

        // create a user.
        val user = User(
            id = userId, // any string
            name = "Tutorial" // name and image are used in the UI
        )

        // for a production app we recommend adding the client to your Application class or di module.
        val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
            context = applicationContext,
            apiKey = "hd8szvscpxvd", // demo API key
            geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
            user = user,
            token = userToken,
        ).build()

        // join a call, which type is `default`
        val call = client.call("livestream", callId)
        lifecycleScope.launch {
            // join the call
            val result = call.join(create = true)
            result.onError {
                Toast.makeText(applicationContext, "uh oh $it", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            }
        }

        setContent {
            // request the Android runtime permissions for the camera and microphone
            LaunchCallPermissions(call = call)

            VideoTheme {
                Text("TODO: render video")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You'll notice that these first 3 lines need their values replaced.

```kotlin
val userToken = "REPLACE_WITH_TOKEN"
val userId = "REPLACE_WITH_USER_ID"
val callId = "REPLACE_WITH_CALL_ID"
```

Replace them now with the values shown below:

<TokenSnippet sampleApp='livestream' displayStyle='credentials' />

In the next step we setup the user:

```kotlin
val user = User(
    id = userId, // any string
    name = "Tutorial" // name and image are used in the UI
)
```

If you don't have an authenticated user you can also use a guest or anonymous user. TODO DOCS
For most apps it's convenient to match your own system of users to grant and remove permissions.

Next we create the client:

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = applicationContext,
    apiKey = "hd8szvscpxvd", // demo API key
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = user,
    token = userToken,
).build()
```

You'll see the `userToken` variable. Your backend typically generates the user token on signup or login.

In the next step we create and join the call. The call object is used for video calls, audio rooms and livestreaming.

```kotlin
val call = client.call("livestream", callId)
lifecycleScope.launch {
    // join the call
    val result = call.join(create = true)
    result.onError {
        Toast.makeText(applicationContext, "uh oh $it", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```

`call.join(create = true)` is the simplest example.
It's also possible to configure settings on the call or add co-hosts. TODO: Docs

### Step 4 - Render the video

In this step we're going to build a UI for showing your local video with a button to start the livestream.
This example uses compose, but you could also use our XML VideoRenderer.

In `MainActivity.kt` replace the `VideoTheme` with the following code.

```kotlin
VideoTheme {
    val participantCount by call.state.participantCounts.collectAsState()
    val connection by call.state.connection.collectAsState()
    val total = participantCount?.total
    val backstage by call.state.backstage.collectAsState()
    val me by call.state.me.collectAsState()
    val video = me?.video?.collectAsState()?.value
    val session by call.state.session.collectAsState()
    val durationInMs by call.state.durationInMs.collectAsState()

    Scaffold(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .background(VideoTheme.colors.appBackground)
            .padding(6.dp),
        contentColor = VideoTheme.colors.appBackground,
        backgroundColor = VideoTheme.colors.appBackground,
        topBar = {
            if (connection == RealtimeConnection.Connected) {
                if (!backstage) {
                    Box(
                        modifier = Modifier
                            .fillMaxWidth()
                            .padding(6.dp)
                    ) {
                        Text(
                            modifier = Modifier
                                .align(Alignment.CenterEnd)
                                .background(
                                    color = VideoTheme.colors.primaryAccent,
                                    shape = RoundedCornerShape(6.dp)
                                )
                                .padding(horizontal = 12.dp, vertical = 4.dp),
                            text = "Live $total",
                            color = VideoTheme.colors.textHighEmphasis
                        )

                        Text(
                            modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.Center),
                            text = "Live for 1:23",
                            color = VideoTheme.colors.textHighEmphasis
                        )
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        bottomBar = {
            Button(
                colors = ButtonDefaults.buttonColors(
                    backgroundColor = VideoTheme.colors.primaryAccent,
                    contentColor = VideoTheme.colors.primaryAccent
                ),
                onClick = {
                    lifecycleScope.launch {
                        if (backstage) call.goLive() else call.stopLive()
                    }
                }
            ) {
                Text(
                    text = if (backstage) "Go Live" else "Stop Broadcast",
                    color = Color.White
                )
            }
        }
    ) {
        VideoRenderer(
            modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxSize()
                .padding(it)
                .clip(RoundedCornerShape(6.dp)),
            call = call,
            video = video,
            videoFallbackContent = {
                Text(text = "Video rendering failed")
            }
        )
    }
}
```

If you now run your app you should see an interface like this:

![Livestream](../assets/tutorial-livestream.png)

When you press **go live** your video will be transmitted.
Press go live in the android app and click the link below to watch it in your browser.

<TokenSnippet sampleApp='livestream' displayStyle='join' />

Let's take a moment to review the compose code above `Call.state` exposes all the stateflow objects you need.
The most important ones are:

```
call.state
call.state.participants
```

The [participant state docs](../03-guides/03-call-and-participant-state.mdx) show all the available data.

The compose layout is vanilla compose other than **[VideoRenderer](../04-ui-components/02-video-renderer.mdx)**.
`VideoRenderer` renders the video and a fallback. You can use it for both rendering the local video and remote video.

### Step 4 - (Optional) Publishing RTMP using OBS

The example above showed how to publish your phone's camera to the livestream.
Almost all livestream software and hardware supports RTMPs.
So let's see how to publish using RTMPs. Feel free to skip this step if you don't need to use RTMPs.

A. Console log the URL & Stream Key println(call.state.ingress.rtmp)

B. Open OBS and go to settings -> stream
- Select "custom" service
- Server: equal to the server URL from the console log
- Stream key: equal to the stream key from the console log

Press start streaming. The RTMP stream will now show up in your call.
Now that we've learned to publish using webrtc or RTMP let's talk about viewing the livestream.

### Step 5 - Viewing a livestream (Webrtc)

Watching a livestream is basically a simplified version of the code we wrote in `MainActivity.kt`

* You don't need to request permissions or enable the camera
*

To change the example above and just watch a livestream:

```kotlin
// remove this
call.camera.enable()
call.microphone.enable()

// and this
LaunchCallPermissions(call = call)
// on the UI side remove the button to go live

// and update this to use the remote video
val me by call.state.me.collectAsState()
val video = me?.video?.collectAsState()
```

Here's the update MainActivity for viewing a call

```kotlin
```

### Step 6 - (Optional) Viewing a livestream with HLS

Another way to view a livestream is using HLS. HLS tends to have a 10 to 20 seconds delay, while the above webrtc approach only has a 100-200ms delay typically.
The benefit that HLS has is that it buffers better under poor network conditions.
So for apps where you expect your users to have poor network, and where a 10 second delay is ok, HLS can be a better option.

Let's show how to broadcast your call to HLS.

```kotlin
call.startBroadcast()
```

After starting the broadcast the HLS url can be found in the call state

```kotlin
call.state.egress.value?.hls
```

You can view the HLS video feed using any open source HLS capable video player.

### 7 - Advanced Features

There are several advanced features that can improve the livestreaming experience:

* ** Co-hosts ** You can add members to your livestream with elevated permissions. So you can have co-hosts, moderators etc.
* ** Custom events ** You can use custom events on the call to share any additional data. Think about showing the score for a game, or any other realtime use case.
* ** Reactions & Chat ** Users can react to the livestream, and you can add chat. This makes for a more engaging experience.
* ** Notifications ** You can notify users via push notifications when the livestream starts
* ** Recording ** The call recording functionality allows you to record the call with various options and layouts

### Recap

It was fun to see just how quickly you can build in-app low latency livestreaming.
Please do let us know if you ran into any issues.
Our team is also happy to review your UI designs and offer recommendations on how to achieve it with Stream.

To recap what we've learned:

* Webrtc is optimal for latency, HLS is slower but buffers better for users with poor connections
* You setup a call: (val call = client.call("livestream", callId))
* The call type "livestream" controls which features are enabled and how permissions are setup
* The livestream by default enables "backstage" mode. This allows you and your co-hosts to setup your mic and camera before allowing people in
* When you join a call, realtime communication is setup for audio & video: (call.join())
* Stateflow objects in call.state and call.state.participants make it easy to build your own UI
* For a livestream the most important one is call.state.???

Calls run on Stream's global edge network of video servers.
Being closer to your users improves the latency and reliability of calls.
The SDKs enable you to build livestreaming, audio rooms and video calling in days.
