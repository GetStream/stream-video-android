## Livestream Tutorial

In this tutorial we'll quickly build a low-latency livestreaming experience similar to Twitch.

* We'll use ultra low latency streaming in this tutorial. Alternatively you can also broadcast to HLS
* The livestream will run on Stream's Edge network of servers around the world
* This architecture allows you to scale to millions of viewers
* To publish the livestream you can use either RTMPs (which is supported by OBS and pretty much all streaming software) or you can publish from your phone

Time to get started, if you have any questions or feedback be sure to let us know via the feedback button.

### Step 1 - Install


### Step 2A - Publish from your phone

The following code shows how to publish from your phone's camera to the call.
Livestreams by default will start in the backstage mode.
The call works, you can join with your fellow call hosts, but participants aren't allowed to join yet.
You can call call.goLive() to start your livestream.

```kotlin
val call = client.call("livestream", "id-here")
call.join()
call.camera.enable()
call.camera.flip() // if you want to flip the camera

call.goLive()

```

### Step 2B - Publish from RTMPs

Alternatively you can publish from RTMPs

TODO: example

```kotlin
```

### Step 3A - Viewing a livestream (Webrtc)

The client setup for someone watching the call is slightly different.

```kotlin
```

```kotlin
val call = client.call("livestream", "id-here")
call.join()

setContent {
    VideoTheme {
        Livestream(call)
    }
}
```

- Participant count?
- Show how long the stream has been running
- Link to docs on the chat integration
- Manually changing the displayed quality
- Muting the audio output of the livestream

### Step 3B - Viewing a livestream (HLS)

Alternatively you can use HLS to view the running call. This means the latency will be higher (typically an extra 10 seconds).
The benefit is that HLS buffers better for viewers.

### Step 4 - Recording a call

The last piece of the puzzle is recording your livestream.
