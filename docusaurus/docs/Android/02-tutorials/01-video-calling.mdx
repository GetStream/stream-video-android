## Video Call Tutorial

This tutorial teaches you how to build your own Zoom/Whatsapp style video calling.

* Calls run on Stream's global edge network for optimal latency
* Permissions give you fine grained control over who can do what
* Dynascale automatically adjusts the video quality and codecs

### Step 1 - Create a new project in android studio

Note that this tutorial was written using Android Studio Flamingo.
Setup steps can vary slightly across Android Studio versions so if you run into trouble be sure to use the latest version of Android Studio.

* Create a new project
* Select "empty activity"
* Name your project "VideoCall"

### Step 2 - Install the SDK & Setup the client

** Add the compose SDK ** to your app's build.gradle file found in app/build.gradle
If you're new to android note that there are 2 build.gradle files, you want to open the one in the app folder.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android-compose:$stream_version"
}
```

### Step 3 - Create & Join a call

Open up `MainActivity.kt` and add the following code to the onCreate method

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        // for a production app we recommend adding the client to your Application class
        val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
             context = context,
             apiKey = apiKey,
             geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
             user,
             token,
        ).build()

        val call = client.call("default", "123")
        call.join(create=true)

        setContent {
            VideoCallTheme {
                // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
                Surface(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
                ) {
                    Greeting("${call.id} has ${call.state.participants.value.size} participants")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the sample app and now join this call via your browser here. Let's keep it open as you go through the tutorial.
You'll see the participant count increase to 2 in your app. Awesome, but let's add some video

### Step 4 - Rendering Video

In this next step we're going to:

A. Use a viewmodel (it nicely cleans up the call after you leave the UI)
B. Render your local video
C. Render the participant's video

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
             context = context,
             apiKey = apiKey,
             geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
             user,
             token,
        ).build()

        val call = client.call("default", "123")
        call.join(create=true)



        setContent {
            VideoCallTheme {
                // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
                Surface(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
                ) {
                    LocalVideo(call.state.me.video)
                    ParticipantVideo(call.state.participants.value.first().video)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5 - A full UI

Stream's video SDK includes UI components that make it simple to launch a video calling experience in hours.
Now that we've seen how to use the lower level APIs, lets build a fully polished calling experience

```kotlin
setContent {
    VideoCallTheme {
        // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
        Surface(
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
            color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
        ) {
            VideoCall() {
                VideoHeader()
                VideoGrid(VideoCard=DefaultVideoCard)
                CallControls()
            }
        }
    }
}

```

When you now run your app you'll see a more polished video UI.
It supports reactions, screensharing, active speaker detection, network quality indicators etc.

### Step 6 - Customizing the UI

TODO: Theming
TODO: Swap the call controls for your own

### Step 7 - PIP

To truly make the experience solid the call should continue running in the background using PIP.
Also, if you answer a phone call while you're on this call, your audio and video should be muted automatically.

TODO: include docs on PIP setup & service

### Conclusion

Mention that we also have quickstarts for livestream and audio rooms
Repeat why you should use Stream
Repeat why this SDK is awesome
