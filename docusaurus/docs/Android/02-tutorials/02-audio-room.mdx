## Audio Room Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you how to build an audio room experience like Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse.

* Backstage mode. You can start the call with your co-hosts and chat a bit before going live
* Calls run on Stream's global edge network for optimal latency and scalability
* There is no cap to how many listeners you can have in a room
* Listeners can raise their hand, and be invited to speak by the host
* Chat for the listeners to ask questions
* Audio tracks are send multiple times for optimal reliability (Opus RED & Opus DTX if you want to geek out)

Time to get started

### Step 1 - Create a new project in android studio

Note that this tutorial was written using Android Studio Flamingo.
Setup steps can vary slightly across Android Studio versions so if you run into trouble be sure to use the latest version of Android Studio.

* Create a new project
* Select "empty activity"
* Name your project "VideoCall"

### Step 2 - Install the SDK & Setup the client

** Add the compose SDK ** to your app's build.gradle file found in app/build.gradle
If you're new to android note that there are 2 build.gradle files, you want to open the one in the app folder.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android-compose:$stream_version"
}
```

### Step 3 - Create & Join a call

Open up `MainActivity.kt` and add the following code to the onCreate method

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        // for a production app we recommend adding the client to your Application class
        val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
             context = context,
             apiKey = apiKey,
             geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
             user,
             token,
        ).build()

        // TODO: specify members with different roles
        val call = client.call("audio-room", "123")
        call.join(create=true)

        setContent {
            VideoCallTheme {
                // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
                Surface(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
                ) {
                    Greeting("${call.id} has ${call.state.participants.value.size} participants")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the sample app and now join this call via your browser here. Let's keep it open as you go through the tutorial.
You'll see the participant count increase to 2 in your app.

### Step 4 - Adding audio room UI elements

In this next step we'll add:

* Room title, room description
* A list of participants
* An indicator for who's speaking


```kotlin

setContent {
    VideoCallTheme {
        // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
        Surface(
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
            color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
        ) {
            Call() {
                call.state.custom["title"] - call.state.custom["description"]
                //participant count... // time the call is running
                SpeakerAvatar(call.state.dominantSpeaker)

                participants.forEach {
                    ParticipantAvatar(it)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// TODO: Define some minimal components

```

### Step 5 - Keeping Audio running in the background

```
Document how this works
```

### Step 6 - Requesting permission to speak

Requesting permission to speak is easy.

```kotlin
val response = call.requestPermissions("send-audio")
// and next the admin will call
val requests = call.state.permissionRequests.value
request.forEach {
    it.grant() // or it.reject()
}
```

### Conclusion

Building an audio room took about 10 minutes.

* Calls run on a global edge network for optimal latency
* There is no cap to how many listeners you can have in a room
* Audio quality is optimized using Opus RED & Opus DTX
