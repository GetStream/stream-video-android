## Audio Room Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you how to build an audio room experience like Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse.

* Backstage mode. You can start the call with your co-hosts and chat a bit before going live
* Calls run on Stream's global edge network for optimal latency and scalability
* There is no cap to how many listeners you can have in a room
* Listeners can raise their hand, and be invited to speak by the host
* Chat for the listeners to ask questions
* Audio tracks are send multiple times for optimal reliability (Opus RED & Opus DTX if you want to geek out)

Time to get started
