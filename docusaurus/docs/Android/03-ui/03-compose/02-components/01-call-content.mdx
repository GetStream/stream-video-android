## CallContent

`CallContent` is a bound component that automatically handles Incoming/Outgoing and Active call components and states. All you have to do is pass it the `CallViewModel`.

<!-- After https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/pull/110 has been merged in there will be only one onCallAction handler -->
```kotlin
@Composable
public fun CallContent(
    viewModel: CallViewModel,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit = viewModel::onCallAction
)
```

<!-- TODO link call actions -->
You can also pass a custom onCallAction handler to handle `CallAction`s which can be found [here]().

## OutgoingCall

To show an outgoing call UI on the screen there are two options. The first one is `OutgoingCallContent`, which is a bound component. By default its state and handlers will depend on the `CallViewModel` which can be overridden.

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun OutgoingCallContent(
    viewModel: CallViewModel,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit = viewModel::onCallAction,
)
```

The second option is the `OutgoingCall`, which is a stateless component. It allows you to provide and control the state directly.

<!-- After https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/pull/110 has been merged in there will be only one onCallAction handler -->
```kotlin
@Composable
public fun OutgoingCall(
    callType: CallType,
    participants: List<CallUser>,
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
)
```

Both allow you to override the `onCallAction` handler and implement custom logic when the user interacts with certain parts of the Call UI.

## IncomingCall

To show an incoming call UI on the screen there are two options. The first one is `IncomingCallContent`, which is a bound component. By default its state and handlers will depend on the `CallViewModel` which can be overridden.

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun IncomingCallContent(
    viewModel: CallViewModel,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit = viewModel::onCallAction,
)
```

The second option is the `IncomingCall`, which is a stateless component. It allows you to provide and control the state directly.

<!-- After https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/pull/110 has been merged in there will be only one onCallAction handler -->
```kotlin
@Composable
public fun IncomingCall(
    callType: CallType,
    participants: List<CallUser>,
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
)
```

Both allow you to override the `onCallAction` handler and implement custom logic when the user interacts with certain parts of the Call UI.

## ActiveCall

To show an active call with all of its participants there are two options. The first on is `ActiveCallContent` which is a bound component. By default its state and  handlers will depend on the `CallViewModel` which can be overridden.

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun ActiveCallContent(
    callViewModel: CallViewModel,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit = callViewModel::onCallAction,
    onParticipantsMenuClick: () -> Unit = callViewModel::showParticipants,
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit = {
        val isShowingParticipantsInfo = callViewModel.isShowingParticipantsInfo.value
        val isShowingAudioDevicePicker = callViewModel.isShowingAudioDevicePicker.value

        if (isShowingParticipantsInfo || isShowingAudioDevicePicker) {
            callViewModel.dismissOptions()
        } else {
            onCallAction(LeaveCall)
        }
    }
)
```

The second option is to use the `ActiveCall` stateless component. It allows you to provide and control the state directly.

```kotlin
public fun ActiveCall(
    call: Call?,
    callState: StreamCallState,
    callMediaState: CallMediaState,
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit,
    onParticipantsMenuClick: () -> Unit,
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
)
```

Both allow you to override some of the handlers:

* **onCallAction**: Handler that notifies that user performed some kind of a `CallAction`.
* **onParticipantsMenuClick**: Handler that notifies that the user wants to see a list of other participants inside the call.
* **onBackPressed**: Handler that notifies of the back pressed actions to show the participants list or go back if it is not open.
