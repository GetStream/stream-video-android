# VideoTheme

The `VideoTheme` component is a wrapper that **you should use as the root** of all Compose Components. It's used to provide the default properties that help us style the application, such as:

* **isDarkMode**: Flag that determines if the application should be themed in light or dark mode.
* **Colors**: Defines a palette of colors we support in the app. These are applied to all components and provide us with a dark/light mode by default, but can be used to override the design system completely.
* **Dimens**: Used for defining the dimensions of various components such as avatars, call controls, video overlays, etc.
* **Typography**: Used for all text elements, to apply different text styles to each component. Can be used to change the typography completely.
* **Shapes**: Defines several shapes we use across our Compose components. Can be used to change the shape of avatars, dialogs, call controls, etc.
* **RippleTheme**: Defines the appearance for ripples. Can be used to override the ripple colors used in light and dark modes.
* **ImageLoaderFactory**: Used to create Coil image loader instances. You can use the default image loader factory, or provide a custom one.

:::note
In case any of these properties are not provided, because you're not using the `VideoTheme` to wrap our Compose UI Components, you'll get an exception saying that required properties are missing.

Let's see how to use `VideoTheme` and how to customize the UI within.components

## Usage

To use the `VideoTheme`, simply wrap your UI content with it, like in the following example:

```kotlin {3,5}
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContent {
        VideoTheme {
            CallContent(viewModel = callViewModel)
        }
    }
}
```

## Customization

To customize the `VideoTheme`, simply override any of the default properties by passing in your custom design style, like so:

```kotlin
setContent {
    VideoTheme(
        shapes = StreamShapes.defaultShapes().copy(
            avatar = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp),
            callButton = RoundedCornerShape(16.dp),
            callControls = RectangleShape,
            callControlsButton = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp)
        )
    ) {
        CallContent(
            viewModel = callViewModel
        )
    }
}
```

### StreamColors

`StreamColors` are used to represent all the colors we use and apply to our components in the SDK.

You can find the definitions of all the colors we expose in the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/blob/main/stream-video-android-compose/src/main/kotlin/io/getstream/video/android/compose/theme/StreamColors.kt), as well as what the default provided colors are.

You can also browse which components are using the colors, to know what will be affected by any change.

### StreamDimens

`StreamDimens` defines different sizes that can be customized in the SDK.

You can find the definitions of all the dimensions we expose in the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/blob/main/stream-video-android-compose/src/main/kotlin/io/getstream/video/android/compose/theme/StreamDimens.kt), as well as what the default dimensions are.

You can also browse which components are using the dimensions, to know what will be affected by any change.

### StreamTypography

`StreamTypography` is used to apply different font weights and sizes to our textual UI components.

You can find all the text style properties we expose in the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/blob/main/stream-video-android-compose/src/main/kotlin/io/getstream/video/android/compose/theme/StreamTypography.kt), as well as what the default styles are.

You can also browse which components are using the styles, to know what will be affected by any change.

### StreamShapes

`StreamShapes` provides a small collection of shapes that let us style our containers.

You can find all the shapes we expose in the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/blob/main/stream-video-android-compose/src/main/kotlin/io/getstream/video/android/compose/theme/StreamShapes.kt), as well as what the default shapes are.

These are really easy to customize, as you've seen before, and can make your app feel closer to your design system.

### RippleTheme

Defines the appearance for ripples. The default ripple theme is `StreamRippleTheme`.

You can find out more about it by reading the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/blob/main/stream-video-android-compose/src/main/kotlin/io/getstream/video/android/compose/theme/StreamRippleTheme.kt).

You can easily customize the ripple colors in light and dark modes by overriding `VideoTheme.rippleTheme` with your own implementation of `RippleTheme`.

### StreamCoilImageLoaderFactory

`StreamCoilImageLoaderFactory.defaultFactory()` provides the default factory that creates new Coil `ImageLoader` instances.

You can find out more about it by reading the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/blob/main/stream-video-android-compose/src/main/kotlin/io/getstream/video/android/compose/imageloading/DefaultStreamCoilImageLoader.kt).

You can easily customize how the images are loaded by passing your own implementation of `StreamCoilImageLoaderFactory` to `VideoTheme`.
