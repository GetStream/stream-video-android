# CallContent

The easiest way to setup a screen that shows incoming, outgoing and active call screens which contain the current participants video feeds and the call controls is to use the `CallContent`.

`CallContent` sets up the following functionality by connecting multiple components:
* [**`OutgoingCall`**](../outgoing-call): When the user is Shows other participants avatars and controls for switching audio/video and canceling the call.
* [**`IncomingCall`**](../incoming-call): Shows

In this section we will cover component at the highest top of the hierarchy which enable you to quickly implement a Video Call app.
These components abstract the logic needed to write a functioning video call experience, which makes them less open to customisation.

## Usage

`CallContent` is at the top of the hierarchy. It is a bound component that automatically handles Incoming/Outgoing and Active call components and states. All you have to do is pass it the `CallViewModel`:

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun CallContent(
    viewModel: CallViewModel,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit = {},
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit = { viewModel.onCallAction(it) },
    pictureInPictureContent: @Composable (Call) -> Unit = { DefaultPictureInPictureContent(it) }
)
```

You can also override handlers and some of the content:

* **onBackPressed**: Handler that notifies of the back pressed actions to show the participants list or go back if it is not open.
* **onCallAction**: Handler that notifies that user performed some kind of a `CallAction`.
* **pictureInPictureContent**: Represents the content that will be shown in picture in picture mode.
