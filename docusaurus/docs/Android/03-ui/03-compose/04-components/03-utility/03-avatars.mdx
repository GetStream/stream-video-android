# Avatar Components

In our Video SDK, we provide a few different avatar based components. The `Avatar` component is a Jetpack Compose utility component that renders an image or initials based on the user state. If the user has an image URL defined in their profile, the component renders the `ImageAvatar` component. Otherwise, it uses the `InitialsAvatar` component to show the user's initials, based on the user `name` or `id`.

Let's see how to use the component.

## Usage

To add the Avatar component to your layout, you can use the `Avatar` composable function like this:

```kotlin
import io.getstream.video.android.compose.ui.components.avatar.Avatar

@Composable
fun MyCustomAvatar(user: User) {
    Avatar(
        modifier = Modifier.size(56.dp),
        imageUrl = user.imageUrl ?: "",
        initials = user.name.initials(),
    )
    // ... rest of your code
}
```

As mentioned, if the `imageUrl` is not empty, the component will try to render the image. Otherwise it will just show the user initials, like so:

![User Initials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17215808/222449548-c28ee995-9724-4194-a358-7c447a377463.png)

This component is very simple, but it allows different types of customization. Let's explore them.

## Handling Actions

The `Avatar` component exposes the following behavior customization:

```kotlin
public fun Avatar(
    imageUrl: String,
    initials: String,
    onClick: (() -> Unit)? = null,
)
```

* `imageUrl`: While a part of the state, if the image exists, it'll be rendered. Otherwise, the behavior of the component changes to render the `initials`.
* `initials`: Used as a fallback for the `imageUrl` being empty or failing to load.
* `onClick`: Handler when the user clicks on the avatar.

You can simply pass these parameters when calling the `Avatar` component, to customize what date it renders and how it behaves when the user clicks on the item.

Customizing UI is much more complex and deep for the `Avatar`. Let's explore it.

## Customization

The `Avatar` allows the following customization options for its UI:

```kotlin
public fun Avatar(
    ..., // state
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    shape: Shape = VideoTheme.shapes.avatar,
    textStyle: TextStyle = VideoTheme.typography.title3Bold,
    contentScale: ContentScale = ContentScale.Crop,
    placeholderPainter: Painter? = null,
    contentDescription: String? = null,
    initialsAvatarOffset: DpOffset = DpOffset(0.dp, 0.dp),
)
```

* `modifier`: Used for styling the base component. Helpful for defining the `size` of the component and adding extra decoration.
* `shape`: How the component is clipped. You can easily customize this component on a global SDK level, by changing the `VideoTheme.shapes.avatar` property of `StreamShapes`. Alternatively, you can pass in a custom shape for each instance of the `Avatar` component you call.
* `textStyle`: Defines the style of text used for the `InitialsAvatar`.
* `contentScale`: Used to define the scale type for the `ImageAvatar`.
* `placeholderPainter`: Renders a placeholder image while the `image` is loading.
* `contentDescription`: Helps define accessibility attributes for easier navigation.
* `initialsAvatarOffset`: Padding offset for the `InitialsAvatar`.

Using these parameters you can completely overhaul how the `Avatar` component looks and behaves. You can change the shape to be a square, squircle or a custom drawn shape, you can change its size, scale type and add placeholders.

On top of that, if you want to customize the `ImageAvatar` or `InitialsAvatar` components, you can use their respective composable functions, like so:

```kotlin
import io.getstream.video.android.compose.ui.components.avatar.Avatar
import io.getstream.video.android.compose.ui.components.avatar.ImageAvatar
import io.getstream.video.android.compose.ui.components.avatar.InitialsAvatar

@Composable
fun MyCustomAvatar(user: User) {
    // If you want us to determine which avatar to render
    Avatar(
        modifier = Modifier.size(56.dp),
        imageUrl = user.imageUrl ?: "",
        initials = user.name.initials(),
    )
    
    // If your state and logic require an image avatar
    ImageAvatar(
        imageUrl = imageUrl,
        modifier = Modifier.size(56.dp),
    )
  
    // If your users don't have images and you want to render their initials
    InitialsAvatar(
        initials = initials,
        modifier = Modifier.size(56.dp),
        textStyle = ... // custom text style
    )
}
```

Note that all of these components have several properties exposed in our `VideoTheme`, such as the initials text style, the color, shape and more.
