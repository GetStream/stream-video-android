# SoundIndicator

If you're looking to build a way for users to know if a person is muted, unmuted or speaking, you can use our `SoundIndicator` component.

It's very simple and represents a few states:

* **Muted**: shows a muted microphone icon to indicate that the user has turned off their audio.
* **Unmuted**: shows a regular microphone icon to indicate that the user has turned their microphone on, but isn't speaking at the moment.
* **Speaking**: shows a speaking indicator that moves as the user talks. In case the user stops talking, it transitions to the **unmuted** state, or **muted** if they disable their microphone.

## Usage

To add the SoundIndicator component to your layout, you can use the `SoundIndicator` composable function like this:

```kotlin
import io.getstream.video.android.compose.ui.components.audio.SoundIndicator

@Composable
fun CustomParticipantUi(participant: CallParticipantState) {
    // ... The rest of your code
    SoundIndicator(
        modifier = ..., // provide UI customization
        state = getSoundIndicatorState( // build the SoundState for the indicator
            hasAudio = participant.hasAudio,
            isSpeaking = participant.isSpeaking
        )
    )
}
```

In the code above, the `state` parameter is the current state of the sound. You can easily build the state using `getSoundIndicatorState`. For now, the state is quite simple, but you can also deconstruct the `SoundIndicator` component and build something more custom and complex yourself. The `modifier` parameter is used to specify the size of the component.

>  **Note**: Make sure to check the internals of `SoundIndicator`, since we have properties exposed in `VideoTheme` that let you customize it, such as its size.

## Customization

Since the `SoundIndicator` is a simple component, it doesn't expose much customization. Mainly, you can customize it using its `modifier` parameter.

On top of that you can apply a different color to the waveform animation when a person is speaking, by overriding `VideoTheme.colors.soundLevels` property of `StreamColors`.
