# ConnectionQualityIndicator

The `ConnectionQualityIndicator`  allows you to display the connection quality of a call for a certain participant. It's fairly simple and takes in a `ConnectionQuality` value to define how good the connection is. This value depends on the data the user sends and receives from the call server.

It's helpful for users to know if their connection quality is poor, because you can show custom UI and messages to the user in case they're not aware.

Let's see how to use the component.

## Usage

To use the `ConnectionQualityIndicator`, you add it anywhere in your custom Composable functions, like so:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyCustomUi(connectionQuality: ConnectionQuality) {
    Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
        // ... The rest of your UI
        ConnectionQualityIndicator(
            connectionQuality = connectionQuality,
            modifier = Modifier.size(56.dp)
        )
    }
}
```

In this small example, you're using the `ConnectionQualityIndicator` within custom UI. You pass in the `ConnectionQuality` as well as `Modifier` for size.

The `ConnectionQuality` enum has the following possible values:

- `CONNECTION_QUALITY_EXCELLENT`: The connection quality is excellent, there are little to no issues in data transfer.
- `CONNECTION_QUALITY_GOOD`: The connection quality is good. There might be smaller issues with data, but nothing that impacts performance.
- `CONNECTION_QUALITY_POOR`: The connection quality is poor. You're probably experiencing quality issues and the performance isn't ideal.
- `CONNECTION_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED`: There is no connection to the call server or there are issues measuring the quality.

By default, the snippet above will produce a UI similar to the following:

The component is very simple and doesn't have any behavior. As such, it doesn't allow any customization for action handling, but it does allow small UI customization.

## Customization

Within the `VideoTheme`, there are a few ways you can customize the look and feel of the `ConnectionQualityIndictator`:

* `StreamDimens.connectionIndicatorBarMaxHeight`: Allows you to customize the max height of the bars.
* `StreamDimens.connectionIndicatorBarWidth`: Changes the width of each bar for the quality.
* `StreamColors.connectionQualityBackground`: Changes the color of the background on which the bars are drawn.
* `StreamColors.connectionQualityBar`: Affects the colors of the quality bars.
* `StreamShapes.connectionQualityIndicator`: Provides the shape of the indicator background.

Overriding and changing these properties within their respective classes allows you to change the look and feel of the component to match your design style.
