## ActiveCall

Finally, `ActiveCallContent` shows the participants video or screenshare and call media state after the user has joined or accepted the call. Here is the component definition:

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun ActiveCallContent(
    callViewModel: CallViewModel,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit = { callViewModel.onCallAction(LeaveCall) },
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit = callViewModel::onCallAction,
    pictureInPictureContent: @Composable (Call) -> Unit = { DefaultPictureInPictureContent(it) }
)
```

It also allows you to override some of the handlers and content:

* **onBackPressed**: Handler that notifies of the back pressed actions to show the participants list or go back if it is not open.
* **onCallAction**: Handler that notifies that user performed some kind of a `CallAction`.
* **pictureInPictureContent**: Represents the content that will be shown in picture in picture mode.

It consists of the next elements:
* [**`CallParticipants`**](../call-participants): shows the current participants in the call.
* [**`CallControls`**](../call-controls): exposes the media controls to the user, to toggle microphone/camera/speakerphone off/on and to leave the call.

`ActiveCallContent` also takes care of the orientation changes and adapts the UI accordingly.

Aside from the standard participant video stream we support screensharing and have components that display the content focusing on it.
