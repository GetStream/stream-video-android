# AbstractComposeCallActivity

The easiest way to set up a screen that allows you to show incoming, outgoing and active calls with the call participants and call controls is to extend `AbstractComposeCallActivity`.

`AbstractComposeCallActivity` sets up the following functionality internally:

* Automatic permission handling required to record and send audio and video.
* `OutgoingCallContent` which provides information about other call participants and exposes outgoing call controls.
* `IncomingCallContent` which provides information about the incoming call participants and exposes incoming call controls.
* `ActiveCallContent` which provides complete UI showing videos of the current call participants and exposes active call controls.
* Picture in picture mode and states handling.

It also sets up all the business logic and styles the UI according to our default design system.

Let's see how to integrate the component.

## Usage

<!-- TODO link tutorial -->
To use the `AbstractComposeCallActivity`, you just need to create an activity extending it and overriding `getStreamVideo`, found inside `StreamVideoProvider` interface, to provide the `StreamVideo` instance, which we crated inside [tutorial](../../01-basics/01-tutorial).

```kotlin
class CallActivity : AbstractComposeCallActivity() {

    override fun getStreamVideo(context: Context): StreamVideo = (applicationContext as VideoApp).streamVideo
}
```

This small snippet wil produce a fully-working solution, as shown in the images below.

## Providing custom `CallViewModelFactory`

The `AbstractComposeCallActivity` itself implements `CallViewModelFactoryProvider` interface which also allows you to override the `getCallViewModelFactory` that allows you to write custom logic on how to provide the factory. This way you can provide custom user providers, in our case it helps us provide test users:

```
override fun getCallViewModelFactory(): CallViewModelFactory {
    return CallViewModelFactory(
        streamVideo = getStreamVideo(this),
        permissionManager = PermissionManagerImpl(applicationContext),
        usersProvider = if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) FakeUsersProvider() else EmptyUsersProvider
    )
}
```
