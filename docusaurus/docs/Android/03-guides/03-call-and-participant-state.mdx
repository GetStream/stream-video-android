title: Call & Participant State
description: How the state is exposed
---

### Video Call State

When you join a call, we'll automatically expose stateflow objects in 3 different places:

```kotlin
val clientState = streamVideo.state
val callState = call.state
val participants = call.state.participants
```

### Call State

Here's an example of how you can access the call state:

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "mycall")
val joinResult = call.join(create=true)
// state is now available at
val state = call.state
```

The following fields are available on the call

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `connection` | Your connection state if you're currently connected to the call |
| `participants` | The list of call participants |
| `totalParticipants` | The count of the total number of participants. This includes anonymous participants |
| `me` | Shortcut to your own participant state |
| `remoteParticipants` | The list of call participants other than yourself |
| `activeSpeakers` | The list of participants who are currently speaking |
| `dominantSpeaker` | The dominant speaker |
| `sortedParticipants` | Participants sorted using the default sorting logic |
| `members` | The list of call members |
| `screenSharingSession` | If someone is screensharing, it will be available here |
| `recording` | Boolean if the call is being recorded or not |
| `blockedUsers` | The users who are blocked from this call |
| `ringingState` | For ringing calls we expose additional state |
| `settings` | The settings for this call |
| `ownCapabilities` | Which actions you have permission to do |
| `hasPermission` | function for checking if you have a certain permission |
| `capabilitiesByRole` | What different roles (user, admin, moderator etc.) are allowed to do |
| `permissionRequests` | If there are active permission requests |
| `backstage` | If a call is in backstage mode or not |
| `broadcasting` | If a call is broadcasting (to HLS) or not |
| `createdAt` | When the call was created |
| `updatedAt` | When the call was updated |
| `startsAt` | When the call is scheduled to start |
| `endedAt` | When the call ended |
| `endedByUser` | User who ended the call |
| `custom` | Custom data on the call |
| `team` | Team that the call is restricted to. Default to null. |
| `createdBy` | Who created the call |
| `ingress` | If there is an active ingress session to this call. IE if you're sending RTMP into the call |
| `reactions` | List of reactions this call received |
| `errors` | Any errors we've encountered during this call |

### Participant State

The `ParticipantsState` is the most essential component used to render a participant in a call. It contains all of the information to render a participant, such as audio & video renderers, availabilities of audio & video, the screen sharing session, reactions, and etc. Here's how you iterate over the participants:

```kotlin
// all participants
val participants: StateFlow<List<ParticipantState>> = call.state.participants
coroutineScope.launch {
    participants.collectLatest { participants ->
        // ..
    }
}

// all participants in Jetpack Compose
val participants: List<ParticipantState> by call.state.participants.collectAsState()
participants.forEach { participantState ->
    // ..
}

// you
val me: StateFlow<ParticipantState?> = call.state.me
```

In Jetpack Compose, you can observe the `ParticipantsState` and render videos like the example below:

```kotlin
// all participants
val participants by call.state.participants.collectAsState()

LazyColumn {
    items(items = participants, key = { it.sessionId }) { participant ->
        ParticipantVideo(call = call, participant = participant)
    }
}

// you
val me by call.state.me.collectAsState()

ParticipantVideo(
    call = call,
    participant = me
)
```

The following fields are available on the participant

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `user` | The user object for this participant |
| `video` | The video object for this participant |
| `audio` | The participant's audio object |
| `screenSharing` | The screensharing object |
| `joinedAt` | When this participant joined |
| `audioLevel` | How loudly this user is talking. Float |
| `audioLevels` | A list of the last 10 audio levels. Convenient for audio visualizations |
| `speaking` | If the user is speaking |
| `connectionQuality` | The participant's connection quality |
| `dominantSpeaker` | If this participant is the dominant speaker or not |
| `lastSpeakingAt` | When this user last spoke (used for sorting in some apps) |

### Client State

```kotlin
// client state is available on the client object
val state = client.state
```

And contains these fields:

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `user` | The user you're currently authenticated as |
| `connection` | The connection state. See ConnectionState |
| `activeCall` | The call you've currently joined |
| `ringingCall` | Contains the call if you're calling someone or someone is calling you |
