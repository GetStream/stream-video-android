description: How reactions and custom events work
---

You can send reactions to your call very easily like the code below:

```kotlin
val response = call.sendReaction(type = "default", emoji = ":raise-hand:")
```

You can also add custom data to the reaction or specify a specific emoji. <!-- isn't the emoji part same as above? -->

```kotlin
val response = call.sendReaction(type = "default", emoji = ":raise-hand:", custom = mapOf("mycustomfield" to "hello"))
```

### Custom Events

In case the reaction system isn't flexible enough we also support custom events.
This is basically just a realtime layer that you can broadcast your own events to.

```kotlin
val response = call.sendCustomEvent(mapOf("type" to "draw", "x" to 10, "y" to 20))
```

### Customization
