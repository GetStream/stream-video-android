The SDK does its best to make working with the camera and microphone easy.
We expose the following objects on the call:

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val camera = call.camera
val microphone = call.microphone
val speaker = call.speaker
```

### Camera Manager

The following methods are available on the camera manager:

```kotlin
call.camera.enable() // enable the camera
call.camera.disable() // disable the camera
call.camera.flip() // switch between front and back camera
call.camera.listDevices() // list of available devices
```

The camera manager also exposes these stateflow objects:

```kotlin
call.camera.direction // front/back
call.camera.status // enabled/disabled.
call.camera.selectedDevice // currently selected camera
call.camera.resolution // resolution
call.camera.availableResolutions // the resolutions that are available
```

### Microphone Manager

The microphone manager supports both bluetooth and regular audio sources:

```kotlin
call.microphone.enable() // enable the microphone
call.microphone.disable() // disable the microphone
call.microphone.select(AudioDevice?) // select a specific audio device
```

These stateflow objects are available:

```kotlin
call.microphone.status // enabled/disabled.
call.microphone.selectedDevice // currently selected microphone
```

### Speaker Manager

The speaker manager allows you to enable/disable the speakerphone and set the volume.

```kotlin
speaker.setVolume(100)
speaker.setVolume(0)

speaker.enableSpeakerPhone()
speaker.disableSpeakerPhone()
```


### Pause & Resume

You'll often want to pause and resume the camera and microphone.
If the device is locked or you receive an incoming call many apps pause the camera.
The APIs make this easy to do

```kotlin
// call.speaker, call.camera and call.microphone all support this
camera.pause()
camera.resume() // goes back to the prior state. if it was off, nothing changes, if it was on, it resumes
```
