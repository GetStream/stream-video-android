title: Joining & Creating Calls
description: An overview of how to create calls and join them
---

### Creating a call

You create a call by specifying a "call type" and a call id.

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val result = call.create()
```

The **call type** controls which features are enabled, and sets up permissions.

For the call id there are a few things to note:

* You can reuse the same call multiple times.
* If you have a unique id for the call we recommend passing that as the id.
* If you don't have a unique id you can leave it empty and we'll generate one for you.

As an example, if you're building a telemedicine app calls will be connected to an appointment.
Using your own appointment id as the **call id** makes it easy to find the call later.

### Joining a call

Joining a call sets up the realtime communication for audio and video.

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val result = call.join()
```

### Call CRUD

Basic CRUD operations are available on the call object

```kotlin
// create
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val result = call.create()

// update
val custom = mutableMapOf("secret" to secret)
val updateResult = call.update(custom = custom)

// get
val getResult = call.get()
```

### Call Create Options

This example shows how to create a call with members and custom data:

```kotlin
val members = listOf("thierry", "tommaso")
val call = client.call("default", randomUUID())

val result = call.create(memberIds = members, custom = mapOf("color" to "red"), ring = true)
```

Members are permanently associated with a call. It allows you to:

* Restrict the ability to join a call only to members
* Send a push notification to members when the call starts

The following options are supported when creating a call:

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memberIds` | A list of users ids to add as members to this call | - |
| `members` | A list of members to add to this call. You can specify the role and custom data on these members | - |
| `custom` | Any custom data you want to store | - |
| `settings` | You can overwrite certain call settings for this specific call. This overwrites the call type standard settings | - |
| `startsAt` | When the call will start. Used for calls scheduled in the future, livestreams, audio rooms etc | - |
| `team` | Restrict the access to this call to a specific team | - |
| `ring` | If you want the call to ring for each member | false |

### Querying Members

You can query the members of the call. This is helpful if you have thousands of members in a call and want to paginate.

```kotlin
val filters = mapOf("user_id" to "jaewoong")
val response = call.queryMembers(filters, listOf(SortField.Desc("created_at")), 5)
```

You can **filter** the member list on these fields, and sort on the selected fields.
Note that you can also query on custom data for the member or the user.

| Option | Description | Sorting Supported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user_id` | The user's id | Yes |
| `role` | The member's role | No |
| `custom` | The custom data on the member | No |
| `created_at` | When the member was created | Yes |
| `updated_at` | When the member was last updated | No |
