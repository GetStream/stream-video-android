For many video calling, livestream or audio rooms apps you'll want to show:

* Upcoming calls
* Calls that are currently live
* Popular livestreams/ audio rooms with a link to the recording

The SDK makes it easy to query calls

### Example Queries

**Calls that are about to start**

```kotlin
val filters = mutableMapOf(
    "members" to mutableMapOf("\$in" to listOf("tommaso")),
    "starts_at" to mutableMapOf("\$lt" to threeHoursFromNow),
    //"ended_at" to false,
)
val sort = listOf(SortField.Asc("starts_at"))
val result = client.queryCalls(filters=filters, sort=sort, limit=10, watch=true)
```

**Calls that are ongoing / currently have participants**

```kotlin
client.queryCalls(mapOf("ongoing" to true)).let { result ->
    result
        .onSuccess { calls: QueriedCalls -> Log.d(TAG, "Query success: $calls") }
        .onError { error: Error -> Log.e(TAG, "Query failure: ${error.message}") }
}
```

**Calls filters on a custom property**

```kotlin
val filters = mutableMapOf(
    "custom.color" to "red",
)
val sort = listOf(SortField.Asc("starts_at"))
val result = client.queryCalls(filters=filters, sort=sort, limit=10, watch=true)
```

**Pagination**

The query response is paginated and the maximum count of items is defined by the `limit` parameter.
Use the `prev` and `next` parameters from the last response as parameters for requesting the next page.

```kotlin
// Request first page (prev and next are not set)
val resultPage1 = client.queryCalls(filters=emptyMap(), limit=10)
...
val resultPage1 = queryResult as Result.Success

// Request second page with prev and next parameters from previous response
val resultPage2 = client.queryCalls(
    filters = emptyMap(),
    limit = 10,
    prev = resultPage1.value.prev,
    next = resultPage1.value.next
)
```

### Fields for Query Calls

You can filter on the following fields

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | The call type. Typically default, livestream etc |
| `id` | The id for this call |
| `cid` | The cid for this call. IE default:123 |
| `created_by_user_id` | The user id who created the call |
| `created_at` | When the call was created |
| `updated_at` | When the call was updated |
| `starts_at` | When the call starts at |
| `ended_at` | When the call ended |
| `backstage` | If the call is in backstage mode or not |
| `members` | Check if you are a member of this call |
| `custom` | You can query custom data using the "custom.myfield" syntax |

Sorting is supported on the fields below:

* `starts_at`
* `created_at`
* `updated_at`
* `ended_at`
* `type`
* `id`
* `cid`

If you specify `watch` the SDK will automatically keep the data about these calls updated.
This allows you to show a live preview of who's in the call.
