## Client & Auth

Before you join a call you need to setup the video client.
This example shows a basic setup:

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
     context = context,
     apiKey = apiKey,
     geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
     user = user,
     token = token,
).build()
```

* The API Key you can find in the dashboard.
* The user can be either authenticated, anonymous or guest.
* Note that you can store custom data on the user object if needed.

Typically, you'll want to initialize the client in your app's `Application` class or a DI module.

### Generating a token

* Tokens are generated server side.
They provide a way to authenticate a user or give access to a specific set of calls.

### Different types of users

* Authenticated users are users that have an account on your app.
* Guest users are temporary user accounts. You can use it to temporarily give someone a name and image when joining a call.
* Anonymous users are users that are not authenticated. It's common to use this for watching a livestream or similar where you aren't authenticated.

This example shows the client setup for a guest user:

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = User(id = "guest", type = UserType.Guest)
).build()
```

And here's an example for an anonymous user

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = User(id = "anonymous", type = UserType.Anonymous)
).build()
```

### Client options

Here's a more complete example of the client options:

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = user,
    token = token,
    tokenProvider = { error ->
        testData.tokens["thierry"]!!
    },
    loggingLevel = LoggingLevel.INFO,
).build()
```

Once you invoke the `build()` method of `StreamVideoBuilder`, you can get the same instance of the `StreamVideo` with the `instance()` methods below:

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideo.instance()
```

If you don't need to use the `StreamVideo` instance anymore, you can uninstall by calling `StreamVideo.uninstall()`

The full list of supported options is:

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiKey` | The API key to use. Found in the dashboard | - |
| `geo` | The GEO routing policy. Defaults to the global edge network. Configure this if you need specific geofencing rules | GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork |
| `user` | The user object. You can store custom data on the user | - |
| `token` | The JWT token to use for authentication | - |
| `tokenProvider` | A function to call if the token is expired or invalid | null |
| `loggingLevel` | The logging level. Recommend to set it to debug while in development | LoggingLevel.BASIC |
| `enablePush` | If push notifications should be enabled | false |
| `pushDeviceGenerators` | Support firebase and other push providers | false |
| `ringNotification` | A function to create your own notification when there's an incoming "ringing" call | null |
| `audioFilters` | Run audio through a filter before sending it | - |
| `videoFilters` | Run video through a filter before sending it | - |
