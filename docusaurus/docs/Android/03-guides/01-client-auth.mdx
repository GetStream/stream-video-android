## Client & Auth

Before joining a call, it is necessary to set up the video client. Here's a basic example:

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
     context = context,
     apiKey = apiKey,
     geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
     user = user,
     token = token,
).build()
```

* The API Key can be found in your dashboard.
* The user can be either authenticated, anonymous or guest.
* Note: You can store custom data on the user object, if required.

Typically, you'll want to initialize the client in your app's `Application` class or a dependency injection module.

### Generating a token

* Tokens need to be generated server side. You can use our server side SDKs to quickly add support for this.
Typically you integrate this into the part of your codebase where you login or register users.
The tokens provide a way to authenticate a user or give access to a specific set of calls.

* Here's a valid user and token to help you get started on the client side, before integrating with your backend API.

### Different types of users

* Authenticated users are users that have an account on your app.
* Guest users are temporary user accounts. You can use it to temporarily give someone a name and image when joining a call.
* Anonymous users are users that are not authenticated. It's common to use this for watching a livestream or similar where you aren't authenticated.

This example shows the client setup for a guest user:

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = User(id = "guest", type = UserType.Guest)
).build()
```

And here's an example for an anonymous user

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = User(id = "anonymous", type = UserType.Anonymous)
).build()
```

### Client options

Here's a more complete example of the client options:

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = user,
    token = token,
    tokenProvider = { error ->
        // make an API call here to get a new token from your backend
    },
    loggingLevel = LoggingLevel(priority = Priority.Debug), // set the logging level
).build()
```

Once you invoke the `build()` method of `StreamVideoBuilder`, you can get the same instance of the `StreamVideo` with the `instance()` methods below:

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideo.instance()
```

If you don't need to use the `StreamVideo` instance anymore, you can uninstall by calling `StreamVideo.uninstall()`

The full list of supported options is:

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiKey` | The API key to use. Found in the dashboard | - |
| `geo` | The GEO routing policy. Defaults to the global edge network. Configure this if you need specific geofencing rules | GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork |
| `user` | The user object. You can store custom data on the user | - |
| `token` | The JWT token to use for authentication | - |
| `tokenProvider` | A function to call if the token is expired or invalid | null |
| `loggingLevel` | The logging level. Recommend to set it to debug while in development | LoggingLevel.BASIC |
| `enablePush` | If push notifications should be enabled | false |
| `pushDeviceGenerators` | Support firebase and other push providers | false |
| `ringNotification` | A function to create your own notification when there's an incoming "ringing" call | null |
| `audioFilters` | Run audio through a filter before sending it | - |
| `videoFilters` | Run video through a filter before sending it | - |
