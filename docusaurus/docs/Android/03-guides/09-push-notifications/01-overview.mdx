Push notifications can be configured to receive updates when the application is closed or on the background, or even app is in a different contextual screen. Stream Video Server sends push notification for Ringing calls and Livestreaming that are about to start to users that have at least one registered device.

To receive push notifications from Stream Video Server, you'll need to:

1. Configure your push notification provider on the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).
2. Add the client-side integration for the chosen provider in your app.
