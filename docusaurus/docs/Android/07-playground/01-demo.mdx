Stream offers playground credentials and demo flows that make it easy for you to perform integration tests with the Stream Video SDK.

### Demo Credentials

You can easily obtain the demo credentials, including the **API Key**, **Token**, **User ID**, and **Call ID**, as shown below:

<TokenSnippet sampleApp='meeting' />


### Joining from the web

For interactive tests across different platforms, you can utilize Stream web applications. This becomes especially helpful when you have a limited number of physical mobile devices but need to test with multiple participants. You can easily conduct tests by opening multiple web browsers.

<TokenSnippet sampleApp='meeting' displayStyle='join' />
