title: Stream Dev Token
description: How to bypass authentication by using dev token
---

When initializing the Stream Video SDK, a user token is required for authentication. This user token (or access token) contains the security credentials for a login session and uniquely identifies the user. Typically, these tokens should be generated by a secure backend server.

However, there can be scenarios, such as when creating a demonstration application with the Stream Video SDK, where setting up a backend server solely for generating user tokens may not be suitable. To accommodate such situations, the Stream Video SDK provides a convenient method for generating a developer token directly on the client side, eliminating the need for backend complications.

If you want to use devloper tokens for your project, you can follow the instructions below.

1. **Go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/)** and select your application.

2. In the **Overview** menu, you can find the **Authentication** category by scrolling to the middle of the page.

3. Toggle on the **Disable Auth Checks** option and **click the Submit** button like the image below.

4. To obtain the developer token, you can simply use the `StreamVideo.devToken()` method, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin
val userId = "my_user_id"
StreamVideoBuilder(
   context = context,
   apiKey = BuildConfig.STREAM_API_KEY,
   token = StreamVideo.devToken(userId), // here!
   user = User(
     id = userId,
     name = "stream",
     image = "http://placekitten.com/200/300",
     role = "admin"
   )
 ).build()
```

You can now utilize the developer token within your development environment for user authentication purposes.

:::note
It's important to remember that the developer token should not be used in production-level projects.
