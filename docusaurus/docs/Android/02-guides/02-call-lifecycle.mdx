## Call Lifecycle

When building your app with **Stream Video**, it's important to understand how the **lifecycle** of your app connects to our client and the Calls you join.

There are two main components that you need to initialize at various points in your app lifecycle:

* **StreamVideo** - The main client which lets you perform CRUD operations with calls.
* **CallClient** - The client which handles just one specific call when the user joins as a participant.

Based on your app, you should initialize these at the latest possible time, when the users really need them, since they might not have to use any of the clients unless they want to engage in video calls.

As a high-level overview, you can see the timeline of these three lifecycle scopes in the following diagram.

> **Note**: While the diagram shows the lifecycle of only one StreamVideo client and CallClient, you can create many instances during a user session, if the user logs in and out multiple times, and joins and leaves multiple calls.

Let's see when it's best to initialize and dispose of these clients.

### StreamVideo

The `StreamVideo` client **requires an authenticated user** to be created and worked with.

If your application has steps where the user doesn't have to be authenticated, like anonymous browsing, exploring the app after installing, but before creating an account, or similar, then we **don't recommend** initializing the `StreamVideo` client right away.

But as soon as your user is authenticated, you can look into creating the client.

Since the instance contains all the operations to access existing calls, as well as create new ones, it's useful to keep it around when your users have access to different call features of your app.

**Some of these include**:

* Browsing a list of calls
* Creating new calls or inviting people to existing
* Ringing a group in chat-based applications or features
* Generating call URLs for invites

Additionally, the instance creates a Web Socket connection that listens to events like `CallCreated`, which you can use to show incoming call UI to your users or trigger custom business logic.

If your app relies on such events at its core, we recommend to initialize it **as soon as your user is authenticated**. Once you do that, make sure to **keep it in a high level component**, like the `Application` class, so you can share the instance.

#### Disposing of StreamVideo

Because the `StreamVideo` relies on user credentials, if your user logs out, you should clear its state and clear the instance. You can do so like this:

```kotlin
fun logOut() { // create this and trigger appropriately
    streamVideo.clearCallState()
    streamVideo = null
}
```

In the snippet above, we take an imaginary function called `logOut()`, which will represent a point in time in your application, when the user chooses to clear their data and log out of the application.

Within it, you first call `StreamVideo.clearCallState()`, which will drop all the state for any calls that are active (if any).

After that, you set your persisted instance to `null`, which will make sure it's fully cleaned up and detached from memory.

### CallClient

The `CallClient` has a much more narrow lifecycle scope. You **initialize it when you want to join a call** and when that call ends, you should clear its state and destroy the instance.

To create the client, simple call `StreamVideo.createCallClient()`, with the corresponding parameters, like so:

```kotlin
val callClient = streamVideo.createCallClient(
    signalUrl,
    userToken,
    iceServers,
    credentialsProvider
)

// alternatively fetch the active instance
val activeClient: CallClient? = streamVideo.getActiveCallClient()
```

`createCallClient()` both returns the client instance to you, so you can immediately use it and it caches the `CallClient` instance within the `StreamVideo` client. You can attempt to fetch the cached instance using `StreamVideo.getActiveCallClient()`, in case it exists. Otherwise it returns `null`.

That way, you can **reuse the client** across multiple screens, in the background with your call still being active, or when switching into a different way of handling your UI, like picture in picture mode.

### Disposing of CallClient

As soon as the call ends, you should dispose of the `CallClient`. If you're using our pre-baked screen UI components, this should be automatic.

If you want to dispose of the instance yourself, however, you can simply call `StreamVideo.clearCallState()`, as described previously:

```kotlin
streamVideo.clearCallState()
```

This will clear its state and set the internal `StreamVideo`'s instance of the `CallClient` to `null`.
