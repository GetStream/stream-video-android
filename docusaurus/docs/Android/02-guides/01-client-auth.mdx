## Client & Auth

Before you join a call you need to setup the video client.
This example shows a basic setup:

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
     context = context,
     apiKey = apiKey,
     geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
     user,
     token,
).build()
```

* The API Key you can find in the dashboard
* The user can be either authenticated, anonymous or guest
* Note that you can store custom data on the user object if needed

Typically you'll want to initialize the client in your app's Application class.

### Generating a token

* Tokens are generated server side.
They provide a way to authenticate a user or give access to a specific set of calls.

### Different types of users

* Authenticated users are users that have an account on your app
* Guest users are temporary user accounts. You can use it to temporarily give someon a name and image when joining a call
* Anonymous users are users that are not authenticated. It's common to use this for watching a livestream or similar where you aren't authenticated.

This example shows the client setup for a guest user.

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = User(id = "guest", type = UserType.Guest)
).build()
```

And here's an example for an anonymous user

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user = User(id = "anonymous", type = UserType.Anonymous)
).build()
```

### Client options

Here's a more complete example of the client options:

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = context,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
    user,
    token,
    tokenProvider = { error ->
        testData.tokens["thierry"]!!
    },
    loggingLevel = LoggingLevel.INFO,
).build()
```
