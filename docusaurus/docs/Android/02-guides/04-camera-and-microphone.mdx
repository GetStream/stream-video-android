The SDK does its best to make working with the camera and microphone easy.
We expose the following objects on the call:

```
val call = client.call("default", "123")
call.camera
call.microphone
call.speaker
```

### Camera Manager

The following methods are available on the camera manager:

```kotlin
call.camera.enable() // enable the camera
call.camera.disable() // disable the camera
call.camera.flip() // switch between front and back camera
call.camera.listDevices() // list of available devices
```

The camera manager also exposes these stateflow objects

```kotlin
call.camera.direction // front/back
call.camera.status // enabled/ disabled.
call.camera.selectedDevice // currently selected camera
call.camera.resolution // resolution
call.camera.availableResolutions // the resolutions that are available
```

### Microphone Manager

The microphone manager supports both bluetooth and regular audio sources

```kotlin
call.microphone.enable() // enable the camera
call.microphone.disable() // disable the camera
call.microphone.select(AudioDevice?) // select a specific audio device
```

These stateflow objects are available:

```kotlin
call.microphone.status // enabled/ disabled.
call.microphone.selectedDevice // currently selected camera
```

### Speaker Manager
