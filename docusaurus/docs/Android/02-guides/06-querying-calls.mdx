## Querying Calls

For many video calling, livestream or audio rooms apps you'll want to show

* Upcoming calls
* Calls that are currently live
* Popular livestreams/ audio rooms with a link to the recording

The SDK makes it easy to query calls

### Example Queries

** Calls that are about to start **

```kotlin
{members:{$in:[thierry]}, starts_at:{"$lt":now.add(3 hour)'}, ended_at:nil}
val filters = mutableMapOf("active" to true)
val result = client.queryCalls(QueryCallsData(filters, limit = 1))
```

** Calls filters on a custom property **

```kotlin
val filters = mutableMapOf("custom.color" to "red")
val result = client.queryCalls(QueryCallsData(filters, limit = 1))
```

** Calls that live/ currently have participants **

```kotlin
TODO
```

### Fields for Query Calls

You can filter on the following fields

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | The call type. Typically default, livestream etc |
| `id` | The id for this call |
| `cid` | The cid for this call. IE default:123 |
| `created_by_user_id` | The user id who created the call |
| `created_at` | When the call was created |
| `updated_at` | When the call was updated |
| `starts_at` | When the call starts at |
| `ended_at` | When the call ended |
| `backstage` | If the call is in backstage mode or not |
| `members` | Check if you are a member of this call |
| `custom` | You can query custom data using the "custom.myfield" syntax |

Sorting is supported on these fields
