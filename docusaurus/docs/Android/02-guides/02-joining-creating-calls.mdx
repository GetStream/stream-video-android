export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span

      backgroundColor: color,

      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.


### Creating a call

You create a call by specifying a "call type" and a call id.

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val result = call.create()
```

The call type controls which features are enabled, and sets up permissions.
For the call id you can pass any unique string.
Note that you can reuse the same call multiple times.
So if you're building a livestream service like Twitch you could have 1 call id per streamer.

### Joining a call

Joining a call sets up the realtime communication for audio and video.

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val result = call.join()
```

### Call CRUD

Basic CRUD operations are available on the call object

```kotlin
// create
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val result = call.create()

// update
val custom = mutableMapOf("secret" to secret)
val updateResult = call.update(custom = custom)

// get
val getResult = call.get()
```

### Call Create Options

This example shows how to create a call with members and custom data

```kotlin
val members = mutableListOf("thierry", "tommaso")
val call = client.call("default", randomUUID())

val result = call.create(memberIds = members, custom = mapOf("color" to "red"), ring=true)
```

Members are permanently associated with a call. It allows you to:

* Restrict the ability to join a call only to members
* Send a push notification to members when the call starts

The following options are supported when creating a call:

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memberIds` | A list of users ids to add as members to this call | - |
| `members` | A list of members to add to this call. You can specify the role and custom data on these members | - |
| `custom` | Any custom data you want to store | - |
| `settings` | You can overwrite certain call settings for this specific call. This overwrites the call type standard settings | - |
| `startsAt` | When the call will start. Used for calls scheduled in the future, livestreams, audio rooms etc | - |
| `team` | Restrict the access to this call to a specific team | - |
| `ring` | If you want the call to ring for each member | false |
