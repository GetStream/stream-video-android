### Call Types

When you create a call like this
```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
```

You create a call of the type "default" with id "123".

There are 4 built-in call types and you can also create your own.

### Default call types

* development: Everything is allowed, no permission checks. Great for development, bad for production usage
* default: Good defaults for 1 on 1 or group calls. This will work for most video calling apps
* audio_room: Default for audio rooms. Calls start out in backstage mode by default and you can go live when you want
* livestream: Default for livestreams

### Features & Settings

The following features and settings are controlled by the call types
