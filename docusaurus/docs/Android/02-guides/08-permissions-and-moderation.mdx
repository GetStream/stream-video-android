## Permissions & Moderation

Permissions for a video call can be quite complicated.
Use cases like educational apps, live events, audio rooms and livestreams require detailed permissions.

### Requesting & Granting permission

This example shows how to check if you have permissions to do something and ask for permission.
Let's say that you've joined an audio room and want to speak

```kotlin
// see if you currently have this permission
val hasPermission = call.state.hasPermission("send-audio").value

// request the host to grant you this permission
val response = call.requestPermissions("send-audio")
```

The host can proceed to grant you permission

TODO: what about handling the permission request

```kotlin
val granResponse = call.grantPermissions("thierry", listOf("send-audio"))
```

You can request the following 3 permissions atm: send-audio, send-video, screenshare

### Moderation Capabilities

You can block a user or remove them from a call

```kotlin
// block a user
val response = call.blockUser("tommaso")

// remove a member from a call
val response = call.removeMember("tommaso")
```

Alternatively you can also mute users

```kotlin
call.muteAllUsers() // mutes all users other than yourself
call.muteUser("tommaso") // mute user with id "tommaso" specifically
```
