## Permissions & Moderation

Permissions for a video call can be quite complicated.
Use cases like educational apps, live events, audio rooms and livestreams require detailed permissions.

### Requesting & Granting permission

This example shows how to check if you have permissions to do something and ask for permission.
Let's say that you've joined an audio room and want to speak

```kotlin
// see if you currently have this permission
val hasPermission = call.state.hasPermission("send-audio").value

// request the host to grant you this permission
val response = call.requestPermissions("send-audio")
```

The host can proceed to grant you permission:

```
val requests = call.state.permissionRequests.value
requests.forEach {
    it.grant() // or it.reject()
}
```

You can also grant permissions directly using `call.grantPermissions()` method like the example below:

```kotlin
val grantResponse = call.grantPermissions("thierry", listOf("send-audio"))
```

You can request the following 3 permissions: send-audio, send-video, and screenshare.

#### Android Runtime Permissions

If you want to facilitate an audio or video call, you should grant the following runtime permissions on Android: `CAMERA`, and `RECORD_AUDIO`.

You can requests those permissions by yourself at the right moment, but you can also request permissions with Stream APIs like the example below:

```kotlin
val permissionManager = PermissionManager.create(
    activity = this,
    onPermissionResult = { permission, isGranted ->
        when (permission) {
            android.Manifest.permission.CAMERA -> { isGranted -> // toggle your camera }
            android.Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO -> { isGranted -> // toggle your microphone }
        }
    },
    onShowRequestPermissionRationale = { // show a message when the user selected don't allow permissions }
)
```

If you use `CallViewModel` with UI components, you can simply pass it to the `CallViewModelFactory` like the example below:

```kotlin
val factory = CallViewModelFactory(
    streamVideo = streamVideo,
    call = streamVideo.call(type = type, id = id),
    permissionManager = permissionManager
)
val vm by viewModels<CallViewModel> { factory }
```

### Moderation Capabilities

You can block a user or remove them from a call

```kotlin
// block a user
val response = call.blockUser("tommaso")

// remove a member from a call
val response = call.removeMember("tommaso")
```

Alternatively you can also mute users

```kotlin
call.muteAllUsers() // mutes all users other than yourself
call.muteUser("tommaso") // mute user with id "tommaso" specifically
```
