## Reactions

It's easy to add reactions to your call.

```kotlin
val response = call.sendReaction("fireworks")
```

You can also add custom data to the reaction or specify a specific emoji

```kotlin
val response = call.sendReaction("raise-hand", "", mapOf("mycustomfield" to "hello"))
```

### Custom Events

In case the reaction system isn't flexible enough we also support custom events.
This is basically just a realtime layer that you can broadcast your own events to.

```kotlin
```
