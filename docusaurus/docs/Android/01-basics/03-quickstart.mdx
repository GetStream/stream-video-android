This quickstart gives you a quick overview of how Stream's video SDKs work

### Client setup & Calls

The example below creates the client. Normally you'd do that in your `Application` class.
Next you create a call object and join the call. We'll specify create=true to create the call if it doesn't exist

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
     context = context,
     apiKey = apiKey,
     geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
     user,
     token,
).build()

val call = client.call("default", "123")
val joinResult = call.join(create=true)
```

`default` is a call type. There are 4 built-in call types and you can also create your own.
The call type controls the permissions and which features are enabled.

### Rendering video

This Jetpack Compose example shows how you can iterate over all participants in a call:

```kotlin
val participants by call.state.participants.collectAsState()
participants.value.forEach {
   val videoTrack = it.videoTrack // contains the video track
   val userName = it.user.name // the user name

   ..
}
```

As you can see the example above, `participants (ParticipantState)` contains all essential information to render videos, such as audio/video tracks, user information, audio/video enabled, etc. You can simply render the video track with our Compose components like the sample below:

```kotlin
CallSingleVideoRenderer(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxSize()
        .clip(RoundedCornerShape(16.dp)),
    call = call,
    participant = participant
)
```

The fields available on the participants are documented [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/blob/main/docusaurus/docs/Android/02-guides/03-call-and-participant-state.mdx#participant-state).

### UI components

The goal of this library is to make it easy to build any type of video/calling experience. You have a few options for the UI:

* Build your own UI components using the state as shown above.
* Use our library of built-in components.
* Mix & Match between your own and built-in components.

The built-in components you can customize using theming and modifiers. Compose is pretty flexible, but there are limits.
So if you get stuck with the built-in components you can always work around it by building your own.
