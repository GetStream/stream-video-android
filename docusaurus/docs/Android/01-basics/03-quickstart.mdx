This quickstart gives you a quick overview of how Stream's video SDKs work

### Client setup & calls

The example below creates the client. Normally you'd do that in your `Application` class.
Next you create a call object and join the call. We'll specify create=true to create the call if it doesn't exist
<!-- call is a verb, should it be named createCall? -->
```kotlin
val client = StreamVideoBuilder(
     context = context,
     apiKey = apiKey,
     geo = GEO.GlobalEdgeNetwork,
     user = user,
     token = token,
).build()

val call = client.call("default", "123")
val joinResult = call.join(create=true)
```
<!-- starting from "in this case" below, bad phrasing -->
**Note**: While you can initialise the SDK on-demand and it's not mandatory to initialise the SDK in the `Application.onCreate()` - it is required to initialise it this way for it to be able to handle incoming call and other types of push notifications. In this case the application process will start, the push notification will be delivered to the SDK automatically but the SDK will not be initialised at this point and will ignore the push notification.

`default` is a call type. There are 4 built-in call types and you can also create your own.
The call type controls the permissions and which features are enabled.

The second argument is the call id and is optional. It's convenient to specify an ID if the call is associated with an object in your database.
As an example if you're building a ride sharing app like Uber, you could use the ride id as the call id to easily align with your internal systems.

### Rendering video

The call's state is available in [`call.state`](../03-guides/03-call-and-participant-state.mdx) and you'll often work with `call.state.participants`.
Have a look below at a basic Compose example of how to render the video of all participants.

```kotlin
val participants by call.state.participants.collectAsState()
participants.forEach {
    val videoTrack = it.videoTrack // contains the video track
    val userName = it.userNameOrId // the user name

    ..
}
```

As you can see the example above, `participants (ParticipantState)` contains all essential information to render videos, such as audio/video tracks, user information, audio/video enabled, etc. You can simply render the video track with our Compose components like the sample below:

```kotlin
ParticipantVideo(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxSize()
        .clip(RoundedCornerShape(16.dp)),
    call = call,
    participant = participant
)
```
<!-- broken link below -->
The fields available on the participants are documented [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/blob/main/docusaurus/docs/Android/02-guides/03-call-and-participant-state.mdx#participant-state).

### Camera & Audio

Most video apps will show buttons to mute/unmute the audio or video and flip the camera.
The example below shows how to use the camera

<!-- code errors below -->

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val camera = call.camera
camera.enable()
camera.disable()
camera.flip()
```

And here's how to enable the microphone or control the speaker volume.

```kotlin
call.microphone.enable()
call.microphone.disable()

call.speaker.setVolume(100)
call.speaker.setVolume(0)
call.speaker.enableSpeakerPhone()
```


### UI components

The goal of this library is to make it easy to build any type of video/calling experience. You have a few options for the UI:

* Build your own UI components using the state as shown above.
* Use our library of built-in components.
* Mix & match between your own and built-in components.

You can customize the built-in components by using theming and modifiers. Compose is pretty flexible, but there are limits, so if you get stuck with the built-in components you can always work around it by building your own.
