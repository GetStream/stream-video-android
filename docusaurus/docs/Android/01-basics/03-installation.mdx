## Dependencies

All Stream Android libraries are available from MavenCentral, with some of their transitive dependencies hosted on Jitpack.

Before you add Stream dependencies, update your repositories in the settings.gradle file to include these two repositories:

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Or if you're using an older project setup, add these repositories in your project level build.gradle file:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Check the Releases page for the latest version and the changelog.

## Available Artifacts

### Low Level Client
To add the low-level Video client library to your app, open your module's build.gradle script and add the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android:$stream_version"
}
```

### Video XML
To use the XML Video Components in your application, add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android-xml:$stream_version"
}
```

Adding the XML Video Components library as a dependency will automatically include the client library.

### Compose Video Components
To use the Compose Video Components instead, add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android-compose:$stream_version"
}
```

Adding the Compose Video Components library as a dependency will automatically include the client library.

### Push Notifications

We ship multiple artifacts to easily integrate Stream Chat with third party push notification providers. See the Push Notification page for more details.

## Versioning

Our Stream Video Android libraries do **not** follow semantic versioning.

We increase the minor version whenever breaking changes are introduced. Patch releases only contain smaller fixes and improvements.

You can keep track of all the changes in the Stream Video Android libraries via the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/releases), and you can also find the release notes of all past releases in our CHANGELOG (TODO create one) file. These will always highlight breaking changes.

We also maintain a separate document, DEPRECATIONS (TODO - create), which lists deprecated constructs in the SDK, with their expected time of further deprecations and eventual removal.
