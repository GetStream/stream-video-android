##  Configuring Call Defaults

While our SDK supports various different use cases, like:

* Live streams
* Audio Rooms
* Messaging & Ringing Apps
* Meetings

You might want to customize the default behavior. We provide that through various properties within the `StreamVideoConfig`.

If you look into the `StreamVideoConfig` definition, here are some of the properties that are exposed:

```kotlin
public interface StreamVideoConfig {

    // Call Behavior
    public val dropTimeout: Long
    public val cancelOnTimeout: Boolean
    public val joinOnAcceptedByCallee: Boolean

    // Default call configuration
    public val autoPublish: Boolean
    public val defaultAudioOn: Boolean
    public val defaultVideoOn: Boolean
    public val defaultSpeakerPhoneOn: Boolean
}
```

The first set of properties define the flow of the call that triggers different events and changes the internal state:

* `dropTimeout`: This is used to define how long clients wait for the user to accept the call, or for other users to accept a ring. After this timeout, the call is either rejected or cancelled.
* `cancelOnTimeout`: Used in pair with `dropTimeout`, you can use this flag to disable cancelling a call automatically, after a timeout.
* `joinOnAcceptedByCallee`: When calling other people, used to define if you want the user to automatically join the call when the first person accepts.

The second set of properties are used for the default configuration when in calls.

* `autoPublish`: Configures if the user automatically publishes audio and video tracks when joining a call. Before publishing, we first check if the user has the required permissions to do so.
* `defaultAudioOn`: If user's audio, or microphone, is automatically on.
* `defaultVideoOn`: If user's video, or camera, is automatically on.
* `defaultSpeakerPhoneOn` If user's speakerphone is automatically on.

You can customize any of these properties by creating an implementation of the `StreamVideoConfig` interface and passing it to the `StreamVideoBuilder`, like so:

```kotlin
val streamVideo = StreamVideoBuilder(
    context = this,
    user = user,
    apiKey = apiKey,
    androidInputs = ...,
    loggingLevel = loggingLevel,
    config = MyCustomConfig()
).build()

// Configuration

private object MyCustomConfig : StreamVideoConfig {
    override val dropTimeout: Long = 600_000L
    override val cancelOnTimeout: Boolean = false
    override val joinOnAcceptedByCallee: Boolean = true

    override val autoPublish: Boolean = false
    override val defaultAudioOn: Boolean = false
    override val defaultVideoOn: Boolean = false
    override val defaultSpeakerPhoneOn: Boolean = true
}
```

In this example you customized how long the timeout is and if the call should be cancelled by default. 

Additionally, you turned off all default publishing for the user in the call and made sure the speakerphone is used by default.
