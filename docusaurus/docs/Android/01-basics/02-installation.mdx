## Dependencies

All Stream Android libraries are available from MavenCentral, so you may not need to do an additional setup.

Before you add Stream dependencies, update your repositories in the `settings.gradle` file to include these two repositories:

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Or if you're using an older project setup, add these repositories in your project level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-android/releases) for the latest version and the changelog.

## Available Artifacts

### Core Client
To add the low-level Video client library to your app, open your module's `build.gradle` script and add the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android-core:$stream_version"
}
```

### Compose Video UI Components
To use the Compose Video Components instead, add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android-compose:$stream_version"
}
```

Adding the Compose Video Components library as a dependency will automatically include the client library.

### Push Notifications

We ship multiple artifacts to easily integrate Stream Chat with third party push notification providers. See the [Push Notification](../06-advanced/02-push-notifications/01-overview.mdx) page for more details.

## Snapshot Builds

Snapshot builds contain are published for the **develop** branch.
Please don't use Snapshot builds in production as they aren't as well tested as our regular releases.

To use snapshot builds, you need to add the Sonatype snapshot repository in your Gradle build configuration (see at the top of this page for where to add this):

```groovy
maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }
```

Then you can add a snapshot dependency on any of our artifacts, replacing the normal version number with a version that has a `-SNAPSHOT` postfix. Our snapshot version is always one patch version ahead of the latest release we've published. If the last stable release was `X.Y.Z`, the snapshot version would be `X.Y.(Z+1)-SNAPSHOT`.

You can browse our available snapshot builds in the [Sonatype snapshot repo](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/getstream/stream-video-android-core/), which you can also check for what the latest available snapshot version is.
