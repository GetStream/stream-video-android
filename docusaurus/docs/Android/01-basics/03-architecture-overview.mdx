## Architecture Overview

As you've learned in the [SDK introduction](02-introduction.mdx), the Stream SDK consists of different artifacts:

* **Low-level client (LLC)**
* UI Components (Compose and XML)
* Push Provider(s)

No matter which parts of our SDK you choose to use, you'll rely on the **low-level client** to set up a connection to our API and handle calls. And it's good to understand the architecture under the hood that powers our API.

Let's dive into the LLC and ways of initializing various components it provides.

## Low-Level Client

The LLC consists of three main constructs that let you easily query and join calls:

+ **StreamVideo**: The main client that you initialize with a user presence. It lets you create, look up and join calls, as well as create the `CallClient`. 
+ **CallClient**: Call-specific client that you initialize when joining a call. It exposes various handles for audio and video devices, muting and unmuting, listening to call specific events and observing the call state. 
+ **CallViewModel**: Higher level wrapper around `StreamVideo` and `CallClient`, that lets you easily control all the state and functionality in a call. It also exposes various pieces of state that lets you render your video call UI.

Using each of these lets you access different functionality that helps you build video calling features. Check out each of the respective pages to learn more details about each component:

* [StreamVideo](../02-client/02-stream-video.mdx)
* [CallClient](../02-client/03-call-client.mdx)
* [CallViewModel](../02-client/04-call-view-model.mdx)

These three components have different scopes of life, so if you want to learn more about creating and disposing of such constructs, read more in our [call lifecycle](../04-guides/01-call-lifecycle.mdx) guide.
