## UI Customization Options

While we provide a generous set of default components and rich behavior in our Stream Video Android SDK, you might be looking for that extra spice to add to your application, through customization.

Most people start off very simply by finishing our [tutorial](01-tutorial.mdx) and then proceed to explore our components and state to apply more customization.

In that case we offer several ways to build applications using our SDK, based on the depth of customization you need:

* **Theming**: We expose a basic theme with a plethora of attributes and styles that are applied to our default set of components, in both [XML](../03-ui/04-xml/03-general-customization/01-video-styles.mdx) and [Jetpack Compose](../03-ui/03-compose/03-general-customization/01-video-theme.mdx) SDK variants. You can use the theme with and without our components.
* **Screen Components**: If you're looking to quickly integrate our SDK without putting in much customization, we offer several [screen-level components](05-default-call-launchers.mdx) and easy out-of-the-box services. These can still be themed and customized, but are not suited for heavily custom apps.
* **Building Blocks & State**: All of our high level components are built using smaller building blocks. On top of that, we expose a **ViewModel** that you can use to observe the state of the call and trigger actions. To learn how to build custom UI, explore some of our popular starter kits:
  * [Live Stream Starter Kit](../02-guides/09-livestream.mdx): Cover popular Live Stream use cases, like Twitch and YT Live.
  * [Audio Rooms Starter Kit](../02-guides/08-audio-rooms.mdx): Build an Audio Room example, like Twitter Spaces.
  * [Video + Chat Starter Kit](../02-guides/07-video-with-chat.mdx): Implement a Zoom or Google Meet like application.
  * [Chat + Video Starter Kit](../02-guides/06-chat-with-video.mdx): Integrate Chat and Video to build a Messenger, Telegram or Viber like app.

* **Low-Level-Client**: If you're looking to avoid our and build fully custom apps, we highly recommend relying on the LLC and the internal state. You can explore the following guides that will help you integrate even the most complex use cases:
  * [Call Lifecycle](../02-guides/02-call-lifecycle.mdx): Learn more about initializing and disposing of our SDK.
  * [Call Engine](../02-guides/03-call-engine.mdx): Dive into our state machine, called `StreamCallEngine` and how to observe it to trigger different UI and events.
  * [Socket Events](../02-guides/04-socket-events.mdx): Within our state, we also expose many socket events and even custom events you can use to build your UI.

On top of all of this, we offer deep documentation on all of our components for both of our SDKs - [Jetpack Compose](../03-ui/03-compose) and [XML](../03-ui/04-xml).

Finally, if you want to dive into common UI use cases, we offer a [UI Cookbook](../06-ui-cookbook) with a set of recipes that should cater to all of your app needs.
