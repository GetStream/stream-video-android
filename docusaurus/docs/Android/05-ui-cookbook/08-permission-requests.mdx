Rendering video and audio calls necessitates [Android Runtime Permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting), which are essential for accessing the camera and microphone. Therefore, you must request Android Runtime permissions to use the camera or microphone, as applicable, before joining a call using the `call.join` function. This step ensures your application adheres to Android's security standards.

The simplest method to request Android Runtime permissions is by using the `LaunchCallPermissions` API before invoking the `join` method. Here's an example of how to do this:

```kotlin
val call = client.call(type = "default", id = callId)
LaunchCallPermissions(call = call) {
    // this lambda function will be executed after all the permissions are granted.
    call.join(create = true)
}
```

Then you'll see the result below before joing the call:

If you want to request permissions without using the `LaunchCallPermissions` API, you can achieve it by using `rememberCallPermissionsState` seamlessly.

```kotlin
val permissionState = rememberCallPermissionsState(call = call)
val allPermissionGranted = permissionState.allPermissionsGranted

Button(onClick = { permissionState.launchPermissionRequest() }) {
    Text(text = "Request permissions")
}

// once all the reuqest permissions have been granted, join the call.
LaunchedEffect(key1 = allPermissionGranted) {
    if (allPermissionGranted){
        call.join(create = true)
    }
}
```

## Request Multiple Permissions

`rememberCallPermissionsState` is built with [accompanist](https://github.com/google/accompanist) under the hood, so it also provides similar functions. You can tweak the list of permissions that you want to request by giving the `permission` parameter.

```kotlin
val permissionState = rememberCallPermissionsState(
    call = call,
    permissions = listOf(
        android.Manifest.permission.CAMERA,
        android.Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO,
        .. // more!
    )
)
```

You can also handle whether each permission was granted or not like the example below:

```kotlin
val permissionState = rememberCallPermissionsState(
    call = call,
    permissions = listOf(
        android.Manifest.permission.CAMERA,
        android.Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO,
    )
) {
    if (it[android.Manifest.permission.CAMERA] == true) {
        call.camera.setEnabled(true)
    } else {
        // shows a toast or dialog
    }

    if (it[android.Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO] == true) {
        call.microphone.setEnabled(true)
    } else {
        // shows a toast or dialog
    }
}
```

So you can execute some additional tasks if a user grants permission, or display a toast message or popup dialog if a user denies permissions.

## Request a Single Permission

You can also simply request a single permission for a camera and microphone like the example below:

```kotlin
// request a camera permission
val cameraPermissionState = rememberCameraPermissionState(call = call)
cameraPermissionState.launchPermissionRequest()

// request a microphone permission
val microphonePermissionState = rememberMicrophonePermissionState(call = call)
microphonePermissionState.launchPermissionRequest()
```
