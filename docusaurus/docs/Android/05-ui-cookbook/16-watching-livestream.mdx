If you want to watch a WebRTC livestream, then you can either use our `LivestreamPlayer`, or build your own component.

## LivestreamPlayer UI component

The `LivestreamPlayer` component shows the following information:

- _live_ indicator
- number of participants
- duration
- _pause/resume_ on tap functionality
- _mute/unmute_ incoming sound

### Basic usage

For standard usage, you just need to pass a `call` object: 

```kotlin
LivestreamPlayer(call = call)
```

### Customization

This is the full signature of the component:

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun LivestreamPlayer(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    call: Call,
    enablePausing: Boolean,
    onPausedPlayer: ((isPaused: Boolean) -> Unit)?,
    backstageContent: @Composable BoxScope.(Call) -> Unit,
    rendererContent: @Composable BoxScope.(Call) -> Unit,
    overlayContent: @Composable BoxScope.(Call) -> Unit
)
```

- `modifier`: Used to apply styling to the component, such as extra borders, background, elevation, size or shape and more.
- `call`: The livestream call to watch.
- `enablePausing`: Controls the _pause/resume_ on tap functionality.
- `onPausedPlayer`: Event handler for the _pause/resume_ on tap event.
- `backstageContent`: Content to show when the call is in backstage mode (i.e. the host has not started the livestream yet)
- `rendererContent`: Used to control how the video feed is rendered on screen. By default, it uses the `VideoRenderer` component under the hood.
- `overlayContent`: Used for customizing the overlay that contains participant count, duration and other info.
