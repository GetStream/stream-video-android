Issues:
* No way to swap the participant card


## Connection Quality indicators

It's important to indicate to users when the connection quality isn't good.
Each participants includes the `connectionQuality` attribute.
In addition you can also monitor your own connection using `call.state.connection`.

Here's a small compose example to render a connection quality icon for each participant

```kotlin
```

You can easily swap out the standard connection quality indicator with your own.

```kotlin
// TODO: show updated example here of your updated ParticipantCard (or however we call it)
```
