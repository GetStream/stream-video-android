## Network Quality Indicators

It's important to indicate to users when the connection quality isn't good.
Each participants (`ParticipantState`) includes the `connectionQuality` attribute.
In addition you can also monitor your own connection using `call.state.networkQuality`.

You can available the `NetworkQualityIndicator` composable component and it is integrated into video render components by default:

## Customization

Here's a small compose example to render a custom connection quality icon for each participant:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun NetworkQualityIndicator(
    modifier: Modifier,
    networkQuality: NetworkQuality
) {
    val color = lerp(Color.Red, Color.Green, networkQuality.quality)

    Canvas(modifier = modifier.size(16.dp)) {
        drawCircle(color)
    }
}
```

You can easily swap out the standard connection quality indicator with your own.

```kotlin
CallContainer(
    modifier = Modifier.background(color = VideoTheme.colors.appBackground),
    videoRenderer = { modifier, call, participant, style ->
        CallSingleVideoRenderer(
            modifier = modifier,
            call = call,
            participant = participant,
            style = style,
            connectionIndicatorContent = {
                NetworkQualityIndicator(
                    modifier = Modifier
                        .align(Alignment.BottomEnd)
                        .padding(8.dp),
                    networkQuality = it
                )
            }
        )
    },
 ..
)
```
