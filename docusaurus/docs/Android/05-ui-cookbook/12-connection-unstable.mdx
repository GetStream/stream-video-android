## Connection Quality indicators

It's important to indicate to users when the connection quality isn't good.
Each participants includes the `connectionQuality` attribute.
In addition you can also monitor your own connection using `call.state.connection`.

Here's a small compose example to render a connection quality icon for each participant

```kotlin
@Composable
fun PoorConnectionAlert(showAlert: MutableState<Boolean>) {
    if (showAlert.value) {
        AlertDialog(
            onDismissRequest = { showAlert.value = false },
            title = { Text("Poor Connection Alert") },
            text = { Text("Your network connection isn't good.") },
            confirmButton = {
                TextButton(onClick = { showAlert.value = false }) {
                    Text("OK")
                }
            }
        )
    }
}
```

You can easily swap out the standard connection quality indicator with your own.
