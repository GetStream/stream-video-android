Issues:
* No way to swap the participant card

The audio indicator gives you a visual feedback when a user is speaking.
To understand who's speaking we provide call.state.dominantSpeaker and call.state.activeSpeakers.
On the participant you can observe participant.speaking, participant.dominantSpeaker and participant.audioLevel

This example shows how to render a visual UI indicator that changes based on the audio level

```kotlin
val audioLevel = participant.audioLevel.collectAsState()



```

And here's how you can update the participant card to use this UI

```kotlin
TODO
```
