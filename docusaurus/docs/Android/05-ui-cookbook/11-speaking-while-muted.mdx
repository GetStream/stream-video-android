Issues:
* No way to add this to the UI

It's a UI best practice to show some visual feedback when the user is speaking while muted.
You can observe the state for this in `call.state.speakingWhileMuted`

### Speaking While Muted

This example shows how to render an alert when the user is speaking while muted

```kotlin
fun SpeakingWhileMutedWarning() {
}
```

### Integrating into the default UI

If you want to integrate this into the default UI, you update it like this

```kotlin
val speakingWhileMuted = call.state.speakingWhileMuted.observeAsState()

CallContent(
 ..
)
```
