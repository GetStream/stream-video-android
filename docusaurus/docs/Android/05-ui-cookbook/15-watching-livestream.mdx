description: How to watch a livestream on android with Kotlin

The example below shows how to render the UI for watching a livestream on Android.
When building a livestreaming UI there are a few things to keep in mind:

* UI for when the video isn't loaded yet
* A message to show when the livestream didn't start yet
* What to show when the livestream stopped
* How to indicate when there are connection problems
* Muting the volume
* Number of participants
* Duration of the call

Here's an example UI for watching a livestream.

```kotlin
VideoTheme {
    val participantCount by call.state.participantCounts.collectAsState()
    val connection by call.state.connection.collectAsState()
    val backstage by call.state.backstage.collectAsState()
    val session by call.state.session.collectAsState()

    // you can have multiple video participants for co-hosts etc, but in this case we only have 1
    val participant = call.state.videoParticipants.collectAsState().value.first()


    val connectionQuality = participant.connectionQuality.collectAsState()
    val video = participant?.video?.collectAsState()

    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .background(VideoTheme.colors.appBackground),
    ) {
        VideoRenderer(call = call, video = video?.value, videoFallbackContent = {

        })

        Column(
            verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Bottom,
            horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().fillMaxHeight().padding(32.dp)

        ) {
            if (connection == RealtimeConnection.Connected) {
                if (!backstage) {
                    Text("Livestream has $participantCount participants")

                    Text("Live for 1:23")
                }
            }
        }

    }
```
