ISSUES
* Fallback method for video provides call. You need the participant (for the avatar, first letter etc. maybe participant and call would be ideal)
* There is no way to tell our UI to use this fallback, or to swap how video is rendered

In terms of design the video fallback can be quite creative.
How do you indicate that someone is speaking? How does the background look.

Here's an example of how to build your own video fallback.
Lets say that someone wants to build a gradient style UI like this:

```kotlin
// render a nice avatar as a fallback
VideoRenderer(call=call, media=participant.video, fallback={ participant ->

})

```

You can integrate your custom fallback like this:

```kotlin
// TODO: there is currently no way to do this
```
