In terms of design the video fallback can be quite creative.
How do you indicate that someone is speaking or their video track is unavailable? How does the background look.

`CallSingleVideoRenderer` and `VideoRenderer` support to show an user avatar for the video fallback by default like the image below:

![User Avatar Background](../assets/cookbook/user-avatar-background.png)

Here's an example of how to build your own video fallback.
Let's say that you want to show a user avatar for video tracks that are not available.

```kotlin
// render a nice avatar as a fallback
VideoRenderer(
    call = call,
    media = media,
    videoFallbackContent = { call ->
        val participant by call.state.participants.collectAsState()
        val user = participant.firstOrNull { it.sessionId == media.sessionId }

        if (user != null) {
            UserAvatar(user = user.initialUser)
        }
    }
)
```

If you use `CallSingleVideoRenderer`, which is built with the full participant information on top of the `VideoRenderer`, it will be much easier:

```kotlin
CallSingleVideoRenderer(
    call = call,
    participant = participant,
    videoFallbackContent = {
        ..
    }
)
```

### Customization

If you want to custom the video fallback from higher-level of components, such as `CallContainer` or `CallContent`, you can achieve it easily by implementing `videoRenderer` composable parameter like the example below:

```kotlin {5-15}
CallContainer(
    modifier = Modifier.background(color = VideoTheme.colors.appBackground),
    callViewModel = vm,
    onBackPressed = { finish() },
    videoRenderer = { modifier, call, participant, style ->
        CallSingleVideoRenderer(
            modifier = modifier,
            call = call,
            participant = participant,
            style = style,
            videoFallbackContent = {
                UserAvatar(user = participant.initialUser)
            }
        )
    },
    ..
)
```
