In most cases you can simply use the stateflow objects Stream exposes.
However for some customizations you'll want to listen to the underlying events that power these state objects.

### Listening to events

Both the call and client object allow you to subscribe to events. You can listen to a specific event or all of them.
This example shows how to listen to all events

```kotlin
val sub = client.subscribe { event: VideoEvent ->
    logger.d { event.toString() }
}
// stop listening
sub.dispose()
```

You can also subscribe for a specific call

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
val sub = call.subscribe { event: VideoEvent ->
    logger.d { event.toString() }
}
// stop listening
sub.dispose()
```

Or listen to a specific event

```kotlin
val sub = client.subscribeFor<ConnectedEvent> { newMessageEvent ->
    logger.d { newMessageEvent.toString() }
}
// stop listening
sub.dispose()
```

### Events

The following events are triggered by the client:
