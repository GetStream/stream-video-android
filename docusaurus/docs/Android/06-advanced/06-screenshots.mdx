## Screenshots

You can take a picture of a `VideoTrack` at highest possible resolution by using `Call.takeScreenshot(videoTrack): Bitmap`. This can be useful for example if you want to take a screenshot of a screenshare at full resolution.

You need to get the right `VideoTrack` to take the screenshot first - the selection depends on your use case. Let's for example take the first participant in the list of participants in a Call:

```kotlin
val participant = call.state.participants.value[0]
val participantVideoTrack = participant.videoTrack.value
if (participantVideoTrack != null) {
    val bitmap = call.takeScreenshot(participantVideoTrack)
    // display, save or share the bitmap
}
```

:::note
A `VideoTrack` can be null when the current participant video is not visible on the screen. Video is only streamed from participants that are currently visible.
:::

Or for example if you specifically want to take a screenshot of a screenshare session:

```kotlin
val screenshareSession = call.state.screenSharingSession.value
val screenShareTrack = screenshareSession?.participant?.screenSharingTrack?.value
if (screenShareTrack != null) {
    val bitmap = call.takeScreenshot(screenShareTrack)
    // display, save or share the bitmap
}
```
