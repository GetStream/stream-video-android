### Recording

The example below shows how to start and stop recording a call

```kotlin
call.startRecording()
call.stopRecording()
```

You can retrieve recordings:

```kotlin
val result = call.listRecordings()
```

There are several layout options... TODO

### Broadcasting to HLS

You can broadcast your call to HLS

```kotlin
call.startBroadcasting()
call.stopBroadcasting()
```

The HLS url is available in the call state

```kotlin

```

### RTMP-in

You can also add RTMPs stream's to your call.

```kotlin
val url = call.state.ingress.value?.rtmp?.address
// TODO: streaming key
```

We plan to add support for other livestreaming protocols in the future. If something is missing be sure to let us know.

### Displaying HLS

On android you can display HLS using ExoPlayer

```kotlin
implementation "androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer:1.0.2"
implementation "androidx.media3:media3-ui:1.0.2"
implementation "androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer-hls:1.0.2"
```
