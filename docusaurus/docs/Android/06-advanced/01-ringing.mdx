## Ring & Notify

You can ring or notify a call. Ring triggers an incoming call style UI for all members of the call.
Notify is a smaller notification. Commonly used when someone starts a livestream, joins a zoom style call etc.

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
call.create()
call.ring()
call.notify()

// you can also ring and notify as a side effect of joining or creating a call
call.create(ring=true, notify=false)
call.join(ring=true, notify=false)
```

Users who receive the incoming call can either accept or reject it

```kotlin
call.accept()
call.reject()
```

The state for ringing calls is available here:

```kotlin
val incomingCall = client.state.incomingCall.value
val accepted = call.state.acceptedBy.value // list of user ids who accepted
val rejected = call.state.rejectedBy.value // list of user ids who rejected
```
