description: How to ring the call and notify all members
---

The `Call` object provides several options to ring and notify users about a call.

### Create and start a ringing call

To create a ring call, we need to set the `ring` flag to `true` and provide the list of members we
want to call. It is important to note that the caller should also be included in the list of
members.
For this, you can use the `create` method from the `Call` object.

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
call.create(ring = true, members = listOf("caller-id", "receiver-1", "receiver-2"))
```

When ring is `true`, a push notification will be sent to the members, provided you have the required
setup for push notifications.
For more details around push notifications, please
check [this page](./02-push-notifications/01-overview.mdx).
If ring is `false`, no push notification will be sent.

### Ring an existing call

If you are sure that a call exists, you can use the `get` method instead:

```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
call.get()
call.ring()
```

The `get()` - `ring()` combination is better used for when calls are created and managed externally
via another system.

### Monitor the outgoing call state

The state of the ringing call is available via the `StreamVideo` client.

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideo.instance()
val ringingCall = client.state.ringingCall
```

This will give you a `StateFlow` which can be monitored.

```kotlin
ringingCall.collectLatest { call ->
    // There is a ringing call
}
```

or simply just get a current value.

```kotlin
val call = ringingCall.value
```

### Canceling an outgoing call

To cancel an outgoing call you can simply `reject` the call from the caller side.
The `reject()` method will notify the endpoint that the call is being rejected and corresponding
events will be sent. In order to cleanup on the caller side, a call to `leave()` is required.
These two usually go together, unless there is a specific reason to keep the channel open for
further
events.

```kotlin
call.reject()
call.leave()
```

### Handle an incoming call

If you have setup [push notifications](./02-push-notifications/01-overview.mdx) properly a "member"
will receive a push notification about an incoming call.

By default the SDK will show the push notification (with a call style) with an option to either
accept or decline the call.

When the user clicks on a push notification. There is an intent fired `ACTION_REJECT_CALL`
or `ACTION_ACCEPT_CALL`.
The

You can learn more about how to
setup [push notifications in the docs](./02-push-notifications/01-overview.mdx).
The docs also explain how to customize the notifications.

### Accept an incoming call

The compose SDK provides built-in components to render and handle an incoming call.

One of them is `StreamCallActivity`. This abstract activity handles everything that is needed for a
call.
Stream also provides a default compose implementation of this activity
called `ComposeStreamCallActivity`.

These components are already predefined and registered in the SDK. If you want to customize them you
can easily extend them as any other activity in Android.

For more details check:

* [UI Component docs for incoming calls](../04-ui-components/04-call/04-ringing-call.mdx)
* UI Cookbook how to
  build [your own incoming call UI](../05-ui-cookbook/05-incoming-and-outgoing-call.mdx)

The Stream SDK provides a way to accept a call within the code so if you are building a new UI, you
can do this via the SDK API.

```kotlin
call.accept()
call.join()
```

The above calls are all you need to accept and join a call.

Its important to note that if there is already an ongoing call you first have to leave that call.

```kotlin
val client = StreamVideo.instance()
val activeCall = client.start.activeCall.value
if (activeCall != null) {
    activeCall.leave()
}
```

All this needs to be done with a component that handles the accept action.

```xml

<action android:name="io.getstream.video.android.action.ACCEPT_CALL" />
```

### Reject an incoming call

Clicking the notification will automatically reject the call.
There are certain instances that you might want to do this manually in your code.

Stream offers a simple API to do this.

```kotlin
call.reject()
```

Note that rejecting the call will notify the caller and other members that the participant rejected
the call. However it will not clean up the local `call` state.
For this you need to leave the call by using:

```kotlin
call.leave()
```

## Ringing sounds

The SDK plays sounds for incoming and outgoing calls. It bundles two sounds for this purpose.

### Customizing the ringing sounds

The ringing sounds can be customized in two ways:
1. Override the bundled resources inside your application.
2. Provide your own `RingingConfig` to the `StreamVideoBuilder`.

#### Override the bundled resources

The resources are: `/raw/call_incoming_sound.mp3` and `/raw/call_outgoing_sound.mp3`.
You can place your own `call_incoming_sound.mp3` and `call_outgoing_sound.mp3` files in the `res/raw` directory of your app.

#### Provide your own `RingingConfig`

You can customize the sounds by creating a `RingingConfig`.

:::note
Currently, the SDK accepts a `Sounds` object in the builder, so once you have a `RingingConfig`, you can
create a `Sounds` object via `ringingConfig.toSounds()` and pass it to the `StreamVideoBuilder`.
:::

The `RingingConfig` interface defines two properties:

- `incomingCallSoundUri`: The URI for the incoming call sound.
- `outgoingCallSoundUri`: The URI for the outgoing call sound.

You can implement this interface and provide your own values for the properties (e.g. a user chosen
URI). After that, create a `Sounds` object (e.g. `ringingConfig.toSounds()` or `Sounds(ringingConfig)`) and pass it to the SDK builder.
If one of the `Uri`s is null the SDK will simply not play that sound and log an error.

:::caution
The `Sounds` class is deprecated and will entirely be replaced by `RingingConfig` in the future.
The current `Sounds` constructor that accepts two integers will always return an `emptyRingingConfig()`
with muted sounds.
:::

`RingingConfig` can also be created via several factory methods:

- `defaultResourcesRingingConfig` - This method returns a `RingingConfig` that uses the SDK's
  default sounds for both incoming and outgoing calls
- `resRingingConfig` - This method returns a `RingingConfig` that uses a resource identifier for both incoming and outgoing calls.
- `uriRingingConfig(Uri, Uri)` - Returns a `RingingConfig` that is configured with two `Uri` objects for the corresponding sounds.
- `emptyRingingConfig` - The SDK will not play any sounds for incoming and outgoing calls.

#### Customization examples

For example, to create a sound config that only includes an incoming sound and no outgoing sound, you can extend `RingingConfig` as shown below, setting `outgoingCallSoundUri` to `null`:

```kotlin
class IncomingOnlyRingingConfig : RingingConfig {
    override val incomingCallSoundUri: Uri =
        Uri.parse("android.resource://$packageName/${R.raw.custom_incoming_sound}")
    
    override val outgoingCallSoundUri: Uri? = null // Outgoing sound will be muted
}
```

Another use case may include a user-chosen sound or a custom sound that is not bundled:

```kotlin
data class UserRingingConfig(
    val incomingCallSoundUri: Uri,
    val outgoingCallSoundUri: Uri
) : RingingConfig
```

:::note
If the sound resources cannot be found (Uri or resource ID) the SDK will simply not play any sound and
log the error.
