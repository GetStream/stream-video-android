description: How to ring the call and notify all members
---
The `Call` object provides several options to ring and notify users about a call.
### Create and start a ringing call

To create a ring call, we need to set the `ring` flag to `true` and provide the list of members we want to call. It is important to note that the caller should also be included in the list of members.
For this, you can use the `create` method from the `Call` object.
```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
call.create(ring = true, members = listOf("caller-id", "receiver-1", "receiver-2"))
```
When ring is `true`, a push notification will be sent to the members, provided you have the required setup for push notifications.
For more details around push notifications, please check [this page](./02-push-notifications/01-overview.mdx).
If ring is `false`, no push notification will be sent.

### Ring an existing call
If you are sure that a call exists, you can use the `get` method instead:
```kotlin
val call = client.call("default", "123")
call.get()
call.ring()
```
The `get()` - `ring()` combination is better used for when calls are created and managed externally via another system.

### Monitor the outgoing call state
The state of the ringing call is available via the `StreamVideo` client.
```kotlin
val client = StreamVideo.instance()
val ringingCall = client.state.ringingCall
```
This will give you a `StateFlow` which can be monitored.
```kotlin
ringingCall.collectLatest { call ->
  // There is a ringing call
}
```
or simply just get a current value.
```kotlin
val call = ringingCall.value
```
### Canceling an outgoing call
To cancel an outgoing call you can simply `reject` the call from the caller side.
The `reject()` method will notify the endpoint that the call is being rejected and corresponding
events will be sent. In order to cleanup on the caller side, a call to `leave()` is required.
These two usually go together, unless there is a specific reason to keep the channel open for further
events.

```kotlin
call.reject()
call.leave()
```

### Handle an incoming call

If you have setup [push notifications](./02-push-notifications/01-overview.mdx) properly a "member"
will receive a push notification about an incoming call.

By default the SDK will show the push notification (with a call style) with an option to either
accept or decline the call.

When the user clicks on a push notification. There is an intent fired `ACTION_REJECT_CALL` or `ACTION_ACCEPT_CALL`.
The

You can learn more about how to setup [push notifications in the docs](./02-push-notifications/01-overview.mdx).
The docs also explain how to customize the notifications.

### Accept an incoming call

The compose SDK provides built-in components to render and handle an incoming call.

One of them is `StreamCallActivity`. This abstract activity handles everything that is needed for a call.
Stream also provides a default compose implementation of this activity called `ComposeStreamCallActivity`.

These components are already predefined and registered in the SDK. If you want to customize them you can easily extend them as any other activity in Android.

For more details check:
* [UI Component docs for incoming calls](../04-ui-components/04-call/04-ringing-call.mdx)
* UI Cookbook how to build [your own incoming call UI](../05-ui-cookbook/05-incoming-and-outgoing-call.mdx)

The Stream SDK provides a way to accept a call within the code so if you are building a new UI, you can do this via the SDK API.
```kotlin
call.accept()
call.join()
```
The above calls are all you need to accept and join a call.

Its important to note that if there is already an ongoing call you first have to leave that call.
```kotlin
val client = StreamVideo.instance()
val activeCall = client.start.activeCall.value
if (activeCall != null) {
  activeCall.leave()
}
```
All this needs to be done with a component that handles the accept action.
```xml
<action android:name="io.getstream.video.android.action.ACCEPT_CALL" />
```

### Reject an incoming call

Clicking the notification will automatically reject the call.
There are certain instances that you might want to do this manually in your code.

Stream offers a simple API to do this.
```kotlin
call.reject()
```

Note that rejecting the call will notify the caller and other members that the participant rejected
the call. However it will not clean up the local `call` state.
For this you need to leave the call by using:
```kotlin
call.leave()
```
