Stream SDK uses [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/datastore) internally to manage user login data safely, consistently, and transactionally. It's basically used internally by Stream SDK, so you don't need to manage it manually. But if you want to access, trace, or use user login data easily, you can use our **datastore** library.
