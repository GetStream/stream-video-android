Push notifications can be configured to receive updates when the application is closed or on the background, or even app is in a different contextual screen. Stream Video Server sends push notification for Ringing calls and Live calls that are about to start to users that have at least one registered device.

Push notifications are sent in the following scenarios:
- you create a call with the `ring` value set to true. In this case, a notification that shows a ringing screen is sent.
- you create a call with the `notify` value set to true. In this case, a regular push notification is sent.
- you haven't answered a call. In this case, a missed call notification is sent (regular push notification).

To receive push notifications from Stream Video Server, you'll need to:

1. Configure your push notification provider on the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).
2. Add the client-side integration for the chosen provider in your app.
