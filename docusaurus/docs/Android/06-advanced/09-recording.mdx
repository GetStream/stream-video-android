In certain situations, you may need to record a call and share the recording with the participants. The Stream Video SDK supports this functionality via the `Call` recording API.

### Start and Stop Recording

To start recording, we simply invoke `call.startRecording()`. To stop recording, we use `call.stopRecording()`.

```kotlin
call.startRecording()
call.stopRecording()
```

The `call.state.recording` property of type `StateFlow<Boolean>` will be updated when call recording starts/stops.

```kotlin
val isRecording by call.state.recording.collectAsStateWithLifecycle() // Use to update the UI
```

### Get a List of Recordings

You can retrieve recordings by using `call.listRecordings()`. If the query is successful, `result` will contain a list of recordings, each containing information about the filename, URL and the start and end times. You can use the URL to show the recording in a video player.

```kotlin
val result = call.listRecordings()

result
    .onSuccess { response: ListRecordingsResponse ->
        response.recordings.forEach { recording: CallRecording ->
            Log.d(TAG, recording.filename)
            Log.d(TAG, recording.url)
            Log.d(TAG, recording.startTime.toString())
            Log.d(TAG, recording.endTime.toString())
        }
    }
    .onError { error: Error ->
        Log.e(TAG, "Failure: ${error.message}")
    }
```

### Listening to Recording Events

You can listen to recording-related events and change to UI accordingly.

```kotlin
val sub = call.subscribeFor(
    CallRecordingStartedEvent::class.java,
    CallRecordingStoppedEvent::class.java,
    CallRecordingReadyEvent::class.java,
    CallRecordingFailedEvent::class.java
) {
    Log.e(TAG, "Event type: ${it.getEventType()}")
}

// stop listening
sub.dispose()
```
