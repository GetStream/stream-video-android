description: How to preview UI components in Android Studio using stream-video-android-mock library
---

[Preview your Composable functions](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling/previews) is really powerful feature of the Android Studio.

Most of Stream Video SDK's UI components rely on the `Call`, `ParticipantState`, and much more, and it's difficult to make mock instances of them.

So we provide a useful library called `stream-video-android-mock` that allows you to get some mock instances of them and write your preview or test codes for Stream Video UI components easily.

You'll be able to build your own preview Composable functions like so:

| Dogfooding (Call Join)                                       | Dogfooding (Call Lobby)                                     | Dogfooding (Call)                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

### Usage

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.getstream/stream-video-android-mock.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=stream-video-android)

To use this library, add the dependency below below to your module's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-video-android-mock:$stream_version"
}
```

Now, you can implement your preview composable like the example below:

```kotlin
@Preview
@Composable
private fun CallContentPreview() {
    StreamMockUtils.initializeStreamVideo(LocalContext.current)
    VideoTheme {
        CallContent(
            modifier = Modifier.background(color = VideoTheme.colors.appBackground),
            call = mockCall,
        )
    }
}
```

After adding the above example to your project, you'll see the preview results on your Android Studio like the images below:

You should follow the steps below to make working well for your preview Composable functions.

1. Initialize a mock `StreamVideo` with the following method: `StreamMockUtils.initializeStreamVideo`.
2. Wrap your composable with the `VideoTheme`.
3. Use the provided mock instances for Stream Video UI components.

This library provide mocked instances below:

- **mockCall**: Mock a `Call` that contains few of mock users.
- **mockParticipant**: Mock a new `ParticipantState` instance.
- **mockParticipantList**: Mock a new list of `ParticipantState` instance.
- **mockUsers**: Mock a list of `User` instance.
- **mockVideoMediaTrack**: Mock a new `MediaTrack` instance.

For example, you can build a preview Composable about `ParticipantVideo` like the example below:

```kotlin
@Preview
@Composable
private fun ParticipantVideoPreview() {
    StreamMockUtils.initializeStreamVideo(LocalContext.current)
    VideoTheme {
        ParticipantVideoRenderer(
            call = mockCall,
            participant = mockParticipant,
        )
    }
}
```

After adding the above example to your project, you'll see the preview results on your Android Studio like the images below:
