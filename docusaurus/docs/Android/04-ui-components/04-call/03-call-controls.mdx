# Control Actions

The `ControlActions` component lets you display any number of controls on the UI, that trigger different actions within a call. We provide default actions, such as changing the audio and video mute state or turning on the speakerphone and leaving the call.

On top of these actions, you can provide a custom set of actions through the API.

Let's see how to use it.

## Usage

To use `ControlActions`, you can simply call it in combination with any custom UI or our other components:

```kotlin
@Composable
private fun CustomUi() {
    VideoTheme {
        Scaffold(
            modifier = modifier,
            contentColor = VideoTheme.colors.appBackground,
            topBar = { CallAppBar(call = call) },
            bottomBar = {
                ControlActions(
                    modifier = ..,
                    call = call,
                    onCallAction = { /* Handle call actions here */ }
                )
            }
        ) { paddings ->
            ParticipantsGrid(
                modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize().padding(paddings),
                call = call,
            )
        }
}
```

In this example, you're doing the following:

1. You observe the required state using the `Call`, which contains a bunch of device's states.
2. Once you have the `Call` instance ready, you build the UI. We omitted modifiers here, as you can arrange the components in any way possible, such as the `CallAppBar` and `ControlActions` taking up a fixed size space, while the `ParticipantsGrid` fills the rest of the parent. `ParticipantsGrid` will take the responsibility of representing the main part of the call.
3. Finally, you add the `ControlActions`. You can customize how these look and which options they represent, but we'll talk about that later.

If you're using this approach and our default set of components, you can expect a UI that's similar to our default implementation:

![Compose CallContent](../../assets/compose_call_container.png)

By default `ControlActions` component covers both portrait and landscape orientation. This means that the actions you pass in will be rendered either in a `Row` of items, horizontally placed, when in portrait, or a `Column`, when in landscape. If you use [CallContent](03-call-content.mdx), `ControlActions` will be configured the layout automatically by observing the configuration changes.

Now that you've seen how to integrate the component and hook it up with the call and state, let's explore customizing the action handlers.

## Handling Actions

`ControlActions` expose the following ways to customize action handling:

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun ControlActions(
    .., // State and UI
    actions: List<(@Composable () -> Unit)> = buildDefaultCallControlActions(
        call = call,
        onCallAction = onCallAction
    ),
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit
)
```

* `actions`: While technically a part of the **component state**, it's still good to think about actions as a part of action handling. We provide a set of default action buttons, so you can selectively use them by your taste or you can build your own custom action buttons.
* `onCallAction`: Handler when the user taps on any of the rendered `actions`. Using this handler, you can build logic for custom actions, or for some of the default provided actions, to customize the behavior.

If you want to customize the actions and how they're used, you can do something like this:

```kotlin
ControlActions(
    .., // State and modifier
    actions = listOf(
        {
            ToggleCameraAction(
                modifier = Modifier.size(60.dp),
                isCameraEnabled = isCameraEnabled,
                onCallAction = onCallAction
            )
        },
        {
            ToggleMicrophoneAction(
                modifier = Modifier.size(60.dp),
                isMicrophoneEnabled = isMicrophoneEnabled,
                onCallAction = onCallAction
            )
        },
    ),
    onCallAction = { action ->
      when (action) {
        is ToggleCamera -> // toggle the camera
        is ToggleMicrophone -> toggle the microphone
         ...
        else -> {
          // handle other control actions
        }
      }
    }
)
```

1. By creating a custom list of Composable, which consist of call control action buttons, you define which actions you want. You could do something like removing the video/camera controls and building an audio-only use case, replacing the flip camera action with a settings wheel for more user input or even adding a Chat icon to support custom Chat UI.
2. Within `ControlActions`, you can override the `onCallAction` parameter to provide a custom handler when the user taps on any of the rendered buttons.
3. You can list out any logic here for any of your custom actions, as well as the default ones that we provide.

![Compose Controls](../../assets/compose_call_controls.png)

There are a couple of our predefined call control actions:

- `ToggleCameraAction`: Used to toggle a camera in a video call.
- `ToggleMicrophoneAction`: Used to toggle a microphone in a video call.
- `FlipCameraAction`: Used to flip a camera in a video call.
- 'LeaveCallAction': Used to leave a call in the call screen.
- `AcceptCallAction`: Represents accepting a call. You can usually use on in the ringing call screen.
- `CancelCallAction`: Represents canceling a call. You can usually use on in the ringing call screen.
- `ChatDialogAction`: Used to display a chat dialog in the video call. You can use this when you need to integrate chat features in the video call.

![Compose ControlActions](../../assets/compose_call_controls_actions.png)

You can create your own control action button and put it into the `actions` parameter and align them like the below:

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun MyCustomAction(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    enabled: Boolean = true,
    onCallAction: (CallAction) -> Unit
) {
    CallControlActionBackground(
        modifier = modifier,
        isEnabled = enabled,
    ) {
        Icon(
            modifier = Modifier
                .padding(13.dp)
                .clickable(enabled = enabled) { onCallAction(CustomAction) },
            tint = VideoTheme.colors.callActionIconEnabled,
            painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.custom_icon),
            contentDescription = stringResource(R.string.call_controls_custom_action)
        )
    }
}
```

Now that you've seen how to customize the behavior of the controls, let's dive deeper into the UI.

## Customization

This is a very simple component so it doesn't have replaceable slots, but it still offers ways to customize its appearance.

* `modifier`: Allows you to customize the size, position, elevation, background and much more of the component. Using this in pair with `VideoTheme` and our [theming guide](../03-video-theme.mdx), you're able to customize the shape of the call controls as well as colors padding and more.
* `actions`: As previously mentioned, by changing the `actions`, you don't only change the possible behavior, but also the appearance. You can use our own predefined action buttons or add your own Composable and tweak orders.

In our [Video Android Tutorial](../../02-tutorials/01-video-calling.mdx), we showcased how to build custom `ControlActions` to remove a chat call action button and only feature camera and audio buttons. The result ended up looking something like this:

![Compose Control Actions](../../assets/compose_call_controls_custom.png)

This allows you to visually change the component, while only changing the actions that are rendered, which is quite useful.
