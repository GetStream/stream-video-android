# Overview

This library aims to make it as easy as possible to build your own video calling, audio rooms and livestreams.
We support a low level client, guides on building your own UI and several prebuild UI components.
If you quickly want to add calling to your app you can do that in just hours with these UI components.

### Rendering a single video

If you only want to render a participant's video:

```
CallSingleVideoRenderer(
    call = call,
    participant = participant,
    labelPosition = Alignment.BottomStart
)
```

### Participant Card

If you want to render a video together with:
* A label/name for the participant
* Network quality indicator
* Mute/unmute indicator
* Fallback for when video is muted
* Speaking indicator
Use this component:

```
CallSingleVideoRenderer(
    call = call,
    participant = participant,
    labelPosition = Alignment.BottomStart
)
```

### Video Call UI

The following example renders a full video calling interface

```Kotlin
VideoTheme {
    CallContent(
        modifier = modifier,
        callViewModel = callViewModel,
        onBackPressed = onBackPressed,
        onCallAction = onCallAction,
        callControlsContent = callControlsContent,
        pictureInPictureContent = pictureInPictureContent
    )
}
```

### Ringing (incoming/outgoing calls)

```Kotlin
VideoTheme {
    RingingCall(
        modifier = Modifier.background(color = VideoTheme.colors.appBackground),
        callViewModel = vm,
        onBackPressed = { finish() },
    )
}
```

## UI Component Customization

The UI components are highly customizable.

* You can change the theme
* You can swap components with your own variations
* Or you can build UI components from scratch
